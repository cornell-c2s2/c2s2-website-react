        <p>
          When determining how to do many of the same calculations in hardware, there are two main approaches we can take.
          <i><b>Iterative</b></i> designs perform the computation using the same hardware, re-using it for all of the iterations of
          calculations that we need. In comparison, <i><b>unrolled</b></i> designs use multiple instantiations of hardware (one for each of
          the calculations) to "unroll" the calculation across space.
        </p>

        <p>
          These two approaches lend themselves towards different applications. Compared to unrolled designs, iterative designs
          use less hardware, as the same piece of hardware is re-used for all calculations. This may make them more appropriate
          for scenarios where area is at a premium, such as embedded systems. This will also cause them to use less power, as
          less hardware needs power to run.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, since an unrolled design has many stages that a given transaction goes through, it can handle multiple
          transactions at once (with each transaction in a different stage in the design). This is known as <i>pipelining</i>, and
          allows our unrolled design to handle more transactions overall, having a higher throughput. A good analogy for
          pipelining is a lunch line. Before each customer has received a complete meal, they must pass through multiple
          stations to pick up various food items. For example, they might receive a sandwich in the first station, a salad in
          the second, and a drink in the third. In this lunch line, there is nothing stopping one customer from picking up a
          salad at the same time the next customer is picking up a sandwich. If our lunch line was iterative, each customer
          would have to wait for the customer in front of them to pick up all three items before they could pick up their first,
          which is a funny idea.
        </p>

        <p>
          These concepts may be hard to grasp at first, so let's do an example! One common operation we might need to do in
          hardware is multiplication. Let's consider the algorithm below (in pseudocode) for multiplying two 32-bit numbers
          using many additions:
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/IterativeVsUnrolledCalculations/image1.png"/>
        </figure>

        <p>
          In this algorithm, we start with our result (<span class="code">r</span>) as 0. Then, each operation of the loop, we
          conditionally increment <span class="code">r</span> by <span class="code">a</span>, depending on whether <span
            class="code">b</span> is odd (in a <a href="./RepresentingNumbersInHardware">binary representation</a>, this is
          determined by whether the last bit of <span class="code">b</span> is one or not). Finally, we shift <span
            class="code">b</span> to the right (dividing it by 2), and shift <span class="code">a</span> to the left
          (multiplying it by two). This is how multiplication is done in binary! For our specific application, since our values
          are 32 bits, we will need to perform 32 multiplication steps in order to compute the product (optimizations could be
          made to this to achieve fewer steps, which we won't cover here)
        </p>

        <p>
          We can see that we need to do the operation inside the <span class="code">while</span> loop many times (we'll refer to
          one execution of this loop as a <i>multiplication step</i>); we can either do this iteratively, or unroll the
          operations in hardware. Our iterative datapath is below, adapted from Cornell's ECE 4750. The green elements are
          <i>registers</i> (used to store values), and the trapezoids are <i>multiplexers</i> (commonly known as <i>muxes</i>),
          used to select between two values (we won't cover the control logic used to control how data moves, colored in blue,
          only the elements involved in the actual computation). From here, you can work through the diagram to identify how it
          corresponds with the above algorithm; notice how it uses the same hardware to perform all of the additions and
          shifting for each step:
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/IterativeVsUnrolledCalculations/image2.png"/>
          <figcaption>Iterative Multiplication Datapath</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          As an alternative, this design could be <i>unrolled</i> in hardware. For this, we can define a module named
          <i>MulUnit</i>, to execute one multiplication step (one iteration of the <span class="code">while</span> loop). To
          unroll the operation, we can instantiate one of these for each iteration we need (in our case, 32)
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/IterativeVsUnrolledCalculations/image3.png"/>
          <figcaption><i>MulUnit</i> Datapath</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/IterativeVsUnrolledCalculations/image4.png"/>
          <figcaption>Unrolled Multiplication Datapath</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Note how if one transaction is in a particular <i>MulUnit</i>, a separate transaction can be in the <i>MulUnit</i>
          behind it, with the transactions moving next to each other through each <i>MulUnit</i> in the chain. This demonstrates
          the <i>pipelining</i> present in the design, and how our unrolled design can handle multiple transactions at once.
        </p>

        <p>
          To get some concrete results, we can turn our designs into actual metal designs through the use of <a
            href="https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane">OpenLANE</a>; this is known as <i>hardening</i> a design,
          and can inform us about what our design would look like in real life. Below are the two die plots for our two designs;
          iterative and unrolled:
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/IterativeVsUnrolledCalculations/image5.png"/>
          <figcaption>Hardened Iterative and Unrolled Multipliers</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          The blue areas (representing wires connecting our design) can give us a rough approximation of where our design is
          (although some may be hard to see; only dense packets of wires appear at this scale). As expected, our unrolled design
          uses a lot more hardware. However, our intuition (about 32 times more) is a little off from our results. To make a
          design, our software often uses <i>cells</i>, which represent individual building blocks (such as an adder, register, etc.).
          Our iterative design used 430 cells in total, whereas our unrolled design used 9,396 cells, a 21.85x increase. This is
          likely due to the extra control logic in the iterative design, to make sure that values are directed correctly and
          that we operate for the correct number of iterations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond this, we also observe a further discrepancy in the total area used; our iterative design occupies 18,850
          mm<sup>2</sup> with all of its cells, but our unrolled design only uses 58,864 mm<sup>2</sup> with all of its cells, a
          3.12x increase. This is because our unrolled design is not only in a regular pattern (allowing the tools to better
          optimize the layout), but because there are only <i>local</i> signals; each wire only travels a short distance to the
          next <i>MulUnit</i>. Conversely, our iterative design features many <i>global</i> signals (signals that travel across
          the entire design), such as our control logic, which makes it harder for our design to optimize the layout. While the
          extra hardware and area for our unrolled design may not be quite as bad as we initially thought, it is still a
          noticeable amount more; we should only use our unrolled design if we can take advantage of the extra throughput, when
          we're able to have multiple multiplications going at once.
        </p>

        <h2>Use in C2S2</h2>

        <p>
          Finally, we can take a peek into an instance where C2S2 has faced this tradeoff! As a part of C2S2's collaboration
          with the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, the digital sub-team has been working on creating a distance calculator. The
          purpose of this module will be to calculate the distance between a bird and its corresponding base station. As we
          know, the distance equation derived from the Pythagorean Theorem requires a square root operation. We created a block
          to calculate the square root of a <a href="./RepresentingNumbersInHardware">fixed point value</a>, named <span 
          class="code">fxpsqrt</span>.
        </p>
        
        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/IterativeVsUnrolledCalculations/image6.png"/>
          <figcaption>Square Root Calculator Datapath</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          To do this we started by creating a square root calculator for non-fixed-point binary integers. After that, it was
          time to add fixed-point-support. Our iterative implementation is great because we just need to run the algorithm for
          more cycles to add fixed point functionality.
        </p>

        <p>
          The algorithm works by splitting the input bits into pairs of two. For the most significant pair, subtract 01. If the
          answer is NOT negative, we append 1 to our answer. If the answer is negative, discard the result and append zero to
          the answer. For the next iteration, we append the next pair of bits to our result and subtract 01 01. We keep doing
          this until the entire input has been processed.
        </p>

        <p>
          If we want to calculate the square root of a 32-bit binary integer, the number of cycles required would be the bit
          width divided by 2 (16 cycles). Now let's say we want to calculate the square root of a 32-bit fixed-point number with
          16 fractional bits. We do this by simply increasing the number of cycles by half the number of fractional bits (16 + 8
          = 24). This means that inputs of varying size can be handled without making hardware changes. If we had unrolled our
          iterative implementation, similar to the multiplier example above, the area of our design would have to increase
          everytime we increased the size of inputs. Although an unrolled architecture would provide higher throughput, it also
          requires more power and area. Our chip must be low-power and low-area, so an iterative architecture is the correct
          choice for the square root block, even at the cost of lower throughput (though no impact on the overall <i>transaction
            delay</i> - the time from start to finish for a given square root calculation)
        </p>

        <p>
          We also know that the distance formula derived from the Pythagorean Theorem requires multiplication. To do this, we
          will use the fixed-point multiplier described above. We will continue to refine and optimize this implementation, and
          look forward to keeping you all updated about the applications of our work!
