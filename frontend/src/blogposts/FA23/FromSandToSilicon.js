            If I asked you to think of some electronic devices, what comes to
            mind? Most people would probably say something along the lines of
            "laptops," "PCs," and "smartphones." These everyday gadgets have
            become integral parts of our lives, and we interact with them
            constantly. But have you ever wondered what enables these devices to
            do what they do? The answer lies in the intricate world of
            semiconductors, and two key players within that world are
            Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Application-Specific
            Integrated Circuits (ASICs).
          </p>

          <p>
            In this blog post, we are going to pull back the curtain, and
            explain a bit more about what FPGAs and ASICs are, and why they are
            so important.
          </p>

          <h2>What is Digital Logic</h2>

          <p>
            All computers work by processing a bunch of data in the form of ones
            and zeros. In digital electronics, we refer to these ones and zeros
            as bits. A bit can either be one or zero at a given time. On these
            bits, you can perform numerous logical operations using logic gates.
            We visualize the output of these logical operations as truth tables,
            which tell us the expected output given two bits at any given state.
            See the graphic below.
          </p>

          </figure>

          <p>
            For example, if I had bits X and Y, holding states one and zero
            respectively, and I performed the AND operation on them, the
            expected output is zero. An AND gate is just one example of the many
            logical operations/gates that exist. Each operation/gate has rather
            simple, well defined behavior, but when combined, are a powerful
            tool. With them, we can construct complex logical expressions that
            allow us to build computers, microprocessors, microcontrollers, etc.

          <h2>What is an FPGA?</h2>

          <p>
            Recall, FPGA stands for Field Programmable Gate Arrays. Believe it
            or not, the name is rather intuitive. An FPGA is an assortment of
            millions of different logic gates constructed into groupings called
            logic elements. The programmer can connect these logic elements
            though a hardware description language (HDL) such as Verilog or
            VHDL. On C2S2, we use Verilog, but other designers have their own
            preferences. FPGA vendors typically provide closed-source IP blocks
            to accelerate the development process and make it easier for
            designers to implement complex functions in their FPGA-based
            designs. They can help save time and effort, as designers don't need
            to create these components from scratch. Furthermore, their
            functionality has already been verified by the vendor. However,
            because they are closed-source, the internal details and source code
            of these IP blocks are not accessible or modifiable by the
            designers. Onboard memory components, such as RAM and flash memory,
            are also frequently integrated into FPGAs. These memory resources
            are essential for storing data and program code, and they can be
            critical for the performance and functionality of FPGA-based
            applications.
          </p>

          <h2>FPGA Design Flow</h2>

          <p>
            The first step in programming an FPGA is implementing your design.
            As I mentioned before, FPGAs are basically just an assortment of
            gates; we need to tell the FPGA how to configure these gates. To do
            this, we write code in our preferred HDL. These HDLs allow us to
            represent combinations of gates though words and operators. For
            example, if I wanted to perform the AND operation on bits X and Y in
            Verilog, I could use the & operator. See the code snippet below.
          </p>

          <span
            className="code"
            style="display: inline-block; text-align: left;"
          >
            logic X; <br />
            logic Y; <br />
            logic result; <br />
            assign X = 1; <br />
            assign Y = 0; <br />
            assign result = X & Y; <br />
          </span>

          <p>
            Once a designer finishes their implementation, they must synthesize
            their design. Synthesis is the process in which the register
            transfer level (RTL) design is converted into a gate-level netlist,
            a representation of the digital circuit using gates and flip-flops
            (a storage element). FPGA vendors provide software in their IDEs
            that take care of the Synthesis stage. As a matter of fact, vendors
            provide software to take care of the remaining steps in the design
            process. After synthesis, the design goes through Place and Route
            (PnR). During placement, the optimal physical arrangement of logic
            elements on the chip's surface is determined, taking into account
            performance, power, and space constraints. Subsequently, routing
            controls the interconnections and wiring paths, ensuring efficient
            signal propagation and adhering to design specifications. Once the
            PnR is completed, the final step is to generate the bitstream. This
            step generates a binary file (the bitstream) that encodes the
            configuration of the FPGA, specifying which logic elements are
            activated, how they are interconnected, and the values of various
            configuration bits. Now that we have generated our bitstream, we can
            flash it to our FPGA, and observe if our design runs. It is also
            good practice to conduct simulation testing on our designs as well.
            This step allows you to simulate the hardware's behavior, and can be
            used to ensure the functionality of a design by conducting tests.

          <h2>What is an ASIC?</h2>

          <p>
            Application Specific Integrated Circuits, or ASICs for short, have
            become more popular in the evolving semiconductor industry and they
            now play a pivotal role in numerous technological domains. Unlike
            general purpose processors that can handle a variety of tasks, ASICs
            are designed to perform specific functions with unparalleled
            efficiency and precision. The idea of an ASIC came about in order to
            keep up with the ever growing demands for better performance. ASICs
            allow you to achieve an invaluable performance optimization since it
            only needs to excel at executing a singular task. With a streamlined
            design that eliminates unnecessary components, ASICs also consume
            less power compared to general purpose processors.

            However, designing an ASIC has its complexities and challenges.
            Engineers need to be well-versed in hardware description languages
            and the intricacies of semiconductor technology. Understanding the
            nuances of the application and how to optimize the design for it is
            critical because that is where ASICs shine in comparison to general
            purpose chips. There is also a long timeline that results from
            multiple phases, including RTL coding, verification, synthesis,
            place and route, power analysis, fabrication, and testing. Each of
            these steps involves meticulous planning, design, and rigorous
            testing to ensure the ASIC functions as intended. Any hiccup in this
            extended timeline could impact project schedules and budgets.
          </p>

          <p>
            The world of ASICs is a complex and intricate one, but the rewards
            are significant. ASICs have the potential to deliver unmatched
            performance, power efficiency, and cost savings in the right
            applications, providing favorable trade offs. Also, there are an
            increasing number of open source hardware tools that can be used to
            facilitate the entire design flow. C2S2 leverages these open source
            hardware tools to allow anyone with the creativity and passion in
            chip design to fulfill this complex but rewarding task.
          </p>

          <h2>FPGA vs. ASIC</h2>

          <p>
            FPGAs and ASICs are both critical components in the world of digital
            design, but they serve different purposes and have unique
            characteristics. ASICs are tailor-made for specific applications.
            This customization allows ASICs to excel in dedicated tasks,
            providing the highest performance and power efficiency. ASICs are
            also smaller and consume less power compared to FPGAs. On the other
            hand, FPGAs are highly flexible and can be reprogrammed to perform
            various tasks. Their architecture consists of programmable logic
            gates, allowing designers to change the functionality of the chip as
            needed. FPGAs are excellent for rapid prototyping and iterative
            development. Engineers can experiment with different designs without
            the high costs and long lead times associated with ASIC development.
            Both technologies have their advantages, and these clearly depict
            why they are so prevalent in the semiconductor industry. Everyone's
            fascination with FPGAs and ASICs stems from their role as the
            foundation upon which our modern world of electronics and computing
            is built, enabling breakthroughs, efficiency, and customization that
            drive technological progress.
