          <h2>FFT Redesign and Optimization</h2>

          <p>
            The Fast Fourier Transform is an algorithm that converts time-domain
            signals into their frequency-domain representations. It has many
            different applications including audio processing, machine learning,
            etc.
          </p>

          <p>
            In an earlier blog, we talked about the design of our ASIC FFT
            accelerator. Figure 1 from that blog post shows the architecture of
            it. This design used a Cooley-Tukey structure, in which each stage
            of the FFT is fully instantiated and FFT is composed recursively
            with smaller FFTs with half the sample points. However, this design
            is not especially space-efficient, because only one stage is used at
            a time, while all other stages are idle. In this blog post, we will
            talk about the optimizations we did to bring massive increases in
            both performance and area efficiency.
          </p>

          </figure>

          <p>
            As in Figure 2 below, the newly optimized FFT adopts an iterative
            approach following the Pease FFT implementation. The Pease FFT is an
            adaptation of the Cooley-Tukey FFT, instead of instantiating all the
            stages with different inputs, it only instantiates one stage that is
            iteratively used. All the butterfly units are fixed in space,
            although their inputs are routed differently from stage to stage.
            This saves the amount of registers and multipliers needed
            drastically, especially for FFTs with large sample sizes (more
            stages). For an 8-point FFT, which has 3 stages, this means reducing
            the number of butterflies from 12 to 4, for a 32-point FFT, which
            has 5 stages, it reduces 80 butterflies to just 16. Furthermore, we
            implemented a multi-butterfly module, which allows several pairs of
            data points to share one butterfly. The butterfly would rotate
            between them and compute one by one. This means that we can adjust
            the number of butterfly modules freely to explore the optimal setup
            between area and performance.
          </p>

          </figure>

          <p>
            Another optimization that is enabled by the reduction of butterfly
            modules is the use of single-cycle multipliers instead of iterative
            multipliers. Previous implementations of the butterfly modules used
            an iterative multiplier design to save space. However, iterative
            multipliers are extremely inefficient: multiplication between two
            32-bit fixed-point numbers takes up to 32 cycles to finish. Since
            the new design has far fewer space constraints, we opted to use a
            single-cycle multiplier, which has higher cycle time and area, but
            far higher area efficiency and overall performance compared to the
            iterative counterparts.

          <h2>Synthesis</h2>

          <h3>The Manual Synthesis Flow</h3>

          <p>
            We synthesize our components using the caravel user project
            repository targeting sky130 PDK. Normally, this is a process that
            takes several steps:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              First, we run <span className="code">pytest</span> in order to
              generate versions of our top-level fft module that has the right
              parameter values set for our design.
            </li>

            <li>
              Next, we copy our files to a clone of the{" "}
              <span className="code">caravel_user_project</span> github
              repository, under the <span className="code">verilog/rtl</span>{" "}
              directory.
            </li>

            <li>
              Then, we run <span className="code">sv2v</span> to convert our
              SystemVerilog code into Verilog.
            </li>

            <li>
              Now that our Verilog is set up, we set up our OpenLANE files in a
              subdirectory of the <span className="code">openlane</span>{" "}
              directory.
            </li>

            <li>
              To fill this out, we need a{" "}
              <span className="code">config.json</span> file to tell OpenLANE
              what configuration we want for our designs, specifying things like
              the target clock period
            </li>

            <figure>
              <img src={image3} />
              <figcaption>
                An example <span className="code">config.json</span>
              </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <li>
              Finally, we fill in <span className="code">pin_order.cfg</span>,
              which tells OpenLANE which cardinal direction to place each of the
              ports in our design.
            </li>

            <li>
              With all our files set up, we can now push things through the flow
              using <span className="code">make design_name</span>.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            This is a process that not only takes many different steps, but{" "}
            <i>is difficult to easily reproduce on other members' machines</i>.
            The <span className="code">caravel_user_project</span> repository is
            an entirely different repository from our workspace repository, so
            we would have to not only copy over many files to a different
            repository with a different structure, we also have to run{" "}
            <span className="code">pytest</span> and find the right file out of
            potentially hundreds of generated files.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most importantly, we often want to generate multiple macros for
            different parameter values, target densities, or clock periods. The
            steps above would have to be repeated for every single one of these
            combinations, which requires a lot of repetitive work that can be
            automated. This leads us to the custom automated caravel script we
            have developed for this exact purpose.
          </p>

          <h3>The Automated Synthesis Flow</h3>

          <p>
            In light of the issues described above, we have developed an
            automated synthesis flow for designs. Instead of all the steps
            needed above, now we only need to describe one config file{" "}
            <i>per verilog module</i>, with support for instantiating multiple
            designs with different parameter values using the same file. This
            new file is in the <span className="code">yaml</span> format as it
            tends to be easier to look at, although our scripts support{" "}
            <span className="code">json</span> as well.
          </p>

          <figure>
            <img src={image4} />
            <figcaption>A new configuration file</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            In this one file, we specify three different FFT designs - an
            8-point, 32-point and 128-point FFT. These designs also have
            different target densities, and to shorten the configuration file as
            much as possible, we can nest designs and have parameter definitions
            propagate from the top-level designs to more specific ones. Other
            than this, we specify a single pin configuration file for our
            designs, and we are ready to synthesize.
          </p>

          <figure style="max-width: min(70%, 300px)">
            <img src={image5} />
            <figcaption>
              An example <span className="code">pin_order.cfg</span>
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            To run synthesis, we type{" "}
            <span className="code">caravel src/fft/pease/fft.yml</span> and our
            designs are automatically synthesized in parallel, and the results
            will be copied to a build directory once synthesis completes. This
            streamlines our work process significantly, allowing us to push
            through the flow quickly and often, facilitating design correctness
            and optimization.
          </p>

          <p>
            The digital design process is characterized by many different
            incredibly powerful but difficult-to-master tools, and one of our
            biggest goals is to simplify this process and lower the learning
            curve so we as students are able to utilize these tools without
            needing years of experience in ASIC design and synthesis.
