          Hi, we're Edmund and Barry, members of the C2S2 digital subteam. Last semester we talked about a complete redesign of
          the FFT, this post will be a follow-up to our previous blog post, and we will talk about some further optimizations to
          the FFT, along with a unified testing framework for all different implementations of the FFT module.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Fast Fourier Transform is an algorithm that converts time-domain signals into their frequency-domain
          representations. It has many different applications including audio processing, machine learning, etc.
        </p>

        <h2>FFT Optimization And Synthesis</h2>

        <p>
          Last semester, we made the switch from a Cooley-Tukey FFT to the Pease FFT implementation, it brought a massive increase
          in performance while using less area. We have made many optimizations from that original implementation and the
          following is our latest block diagram.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/VerifyBetterFFT/image2.png"/>
          <figcaption><strong>Figure 2</strong></figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          The diagram on the left is our implementation from last semester, and the one on the right is our latest design.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you might have noticed, we have abandoned the multiplexed butterfly unit because it adds too much routing overhead
          and stresses our synthesis tools. We now have a butterfly for every pair of inputs, but by doing so, we can also save
          two sets of registers now that the butterfly is single-cycle.
        </p>

          two sets of registers now that the butterfly is single-cycle.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have pushed various different parameterized versions of the FFT through synthesis and the following table shows all
          the synthesis results.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/VerifyBetterFFT/image3.png"/>
          <figcaption><strong>Figure 3</strong></figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Out of all the different versions, we picked the 32-point Pease FFT with a bit width of 16, because the accuracy of FFT
          results benefit more from increased kernel width than bit width. Our new FFT operates on a 32-point FFT with almost the
          same CPI as the 8-point FFT in our tape-in from last year, this would bring accurate frequency results, and help make
          bird rattle classification more accurate.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our key takeaway from the FFT is that we should always keep synthesis in mind in writing RTL code, think about the
          capabilities of the tools, and push through flows early. This helps us understand how different components affect area
          and methodology, otherwise, we wouldn't know what to optimize for.
        </p>

        <h2>Unified FFT Testing Framework</h2>

        <p>
          One of our focuses when writing hardware is also thorough testing, not just of the FFT but also of modules and
          components interacting with the FFT. In our case, we want our FFT to run on audio samples of bird calls, so that a later
          classification module can decide whether or not to record the audio sample.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our old FFT was tested on a combination of manually calculated expected inputs and outputs (mostly for nice single
          frequency inputs), and a number of randomized tests comparing our outputs against numpy's FFT. While this can be an
          effective method to test for accuracy, the specifics of our FFT implementation meant our accuracy would vary, not only
          because of fixed-point arithmetic imprecision but also the order in which math operations were applied. As shown in the
          diagram below, different amounts of decimal points and different FFT widths can lead to drastically different outputs
          even given the same input.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/VerifyBetterFFT/image4.png"/>
          <figcaption><strong>Figure 4</strong></figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          The existing method to achieve bit-accurate results is to simulate the FFT in verilator, a very compute-heavy process
          that is infeasible especially if we want to run the FFT millions of times on actual audio samples. Because of this,
          testing adjacent components can become incredibly slow and tedious if we have to hook up these modules to the FFT at the
          RTL level. Because of this, one of the most important parts of designing hardware is in fact designing software
          simulations- algorithms that perform exactly the same operation as a hardware module. Implementing the same algorithm in
          both hardware and software can help catch bugs- even if two algorithms are supposed to do the same thing, the thought
          process in designing for hardware is very different from software, so re-implementing can often lead to mismatches in
          behavior. This encourages re-evaluation of both algorithms, and can help ensure their accuracy
        </p>

        <p>
          This is not to say that comparing the two is enough, however- testing against a verified algorithm (such as numpy) and
          including edge cases are both still important parts of verifying a design. This method of building identical software
          and hardware modules is helpful especially when it comes to putting together different modules, where a behavioral model
          written in software can be made by putting together smaller models, just as we would in verilog. Eventually, the goal is
          to test this software model against both RTL simulations and on the physical silicon, to ensure that behavior is uniform
          at all levels of abstraction.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of our biggest takeaways from working with hardware is the importance of testing thoroughly and often. When working
          with hardware, it is imperative to make sure that code is correct at all levels, which requires thorough tests that can
          easily be ported to compare many different possible backends, whether it be RTL, Gate level, or the physical die. Many
          things can lead to mistakes, whether it be undefined behavior in verilog that behaves differently in simulation, or
          improper resetting that isn't caught at the RTL level. Building abstract software models allows us as designers to
          reevaluate our algorithms at a higher level, simplifying away some of the intricacies of HDL programming and helping us
          catch bugs along the way.
