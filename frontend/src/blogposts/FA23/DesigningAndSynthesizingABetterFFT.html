        <h2>FFT Redesign and Optimization</h2>

        <p>
          The Fast Fourier Transform is an algorithm that converts time-domain signals into their frequency-domain
          representations. It has many different applications including audio processing, machine learning, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          In an earlier blog, we talked about the design of our ASIC FFT accelerator. Figure 1 from that blog post shows the
          architecture of it. This design used a Cooley-Tukey structure, in which each stage of the FFT is fully instantiated
          and FFT is composed recursively with smaller FFTs with half the sample points. However, this design is not especially
          space-efficient, because only one stage is used at a time, while all other stages are idle. In this blog post, we will
          talk about the optimizations we did to bring massive increases in both performance and area efficiency.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/DesigningAndSynthesizingABetterFFT/image1.png"/>
          <figcaption><strong>Figure 1</strong><br>Earlier FFT Topology</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          As in Figure 2 below, the newly optimized FFT adopts an iterative approach following the Pease FFT implementation. The
          Pease FFT is an adaptation of the Cooley-Tukey FFT, instead of instantiating all the stages with different inputs, it
          only instantiates one stage that is iteratively used. All the butterfly units are fixed in space, although their
          inputs are routed differently from stage to stage. This saves the amount of registers and multipliers needed
          drastically, especially for FFTs with large sample sizes (more stages). For an 8-point FFT, which has 3 stages, this
          means reducing the number of butterflies from 12 to 4, for a 32-point FFT, which has 5 stages, it reduces 80
          butterflies to just 16. Furthermore, we implemented a multi-butterfly module, which allows several pairs of data
          points to share one butterfly. The butterfly would rotate between them and compute one by one. This means that we can
          adjust the number of butterfly modules freely to explore the optimal setup between area and performance.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/DesigningAndSynthesizingABetterFFT/image2.png"/>
          <figcaption><strong>Figure 2</strong><br>Updated FFT Topology</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Another optimization that is enabled by the reduction of butterfly modules is the use of single-cycle multipliers
          instead of iterative multipliers. Previous implementations of the butterfly modules used an iterative multiplier
          design to save space. However, iterative multipliers are extremely inefficient: multiplication between two 32-bit
          fixed-point numbers takes up to 32 cycles to finish. Since the new design has far fewer space constraints, we opted to
          use a single-cycle multiplier, which has higher cycle time and area, but far higher area efficiency and overall
          performance compared to the iterative counterparts.
        </p>

        <h2>Synthesis</h2>

        <h3>The Manual Synthesis Flow</h3>

        <p>
          We synthesize our components using the caravel user project repository targeting sky130 PDK. Normally, this is a
          process that takes several steps:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>First, we run <span class=code>pytest</span> in order to generate versions of our top-level fft module that has
            the right parameter values set for our design.</li>
        
          <li>Next, we copy our files to a clone of the <span class="code">caravel_user_project</span> github repository, under
            the <span class="code">verilog/rtl</span> directory.</li>
        
          <li>Then, we run <span class="code">sv2v</span> to convert our SystemVerilog code into Verilog.</li>
        
          <li>Now that our Verilog is set up, we set up our OpenLANE files in a subdirectory of the <span
              class="code">openlane</span> directory.</li>
        
          <li>To fill this out, we need a <span class="code">config.json</span> file to tell OpenLANE what configuration we want
            for our designs, specifying things like the target clock period</li>

            <figure>
              <img src="imgs/DesigningAndSynthesizingABetterFFT/image3.png"/>
              <figcaption>An example <span class="code">config.json</span></figcaption>
            </figure>
        
          <li>Finally, we fill in <span class="code">pin_order.cfg</span>, which tells OpenLANE which cardinal direction to
            place each of the ports in our design.</li>
        
          <li>With all our files set up, we can now push things through the flow using <span class="code">make
              design_name</span>.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          This is a process that not only takes many different steps, but <i>is difficult to easily reproduce on other members'
            machines</i>. The <span class="code">caravel_user_project</span> repository is an entirely different repository from
          our workspace repository, so we would have to not only copy over many files to a different repository with a different
          structure, we also have to run <span class="code">pytest</span> and find the right file out of potentially hundreds of
          generated files.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most importantly, we often want to generate multiple macros for different parameter values, target densities, or clock
          periods. The steps above would have to be repeated for every single one of these combinations, which requires a lot of
          repetitive work that can be automated. This leads us to the custom automated caravel script we have developed for this
          exact purpose.
        </p>

        <h3>The Automated Synthesis Flow</h3>

        <p>
          In light of the issues described above, we have developed an automated synthesis flow for designs. Instead of all the
          steps needed above, now we only need to describe one config file <i>per verilog module</i>, with support for
          instantiating multiple designs with different parameter values using the same file. This new file is in the <span
            class="code">yaml</span> format as it tends to be easier to look at, although our scripts support <span
            class="code">json</span> as well.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/DesigningAndSynthesizingABetterFFT/image4.png"/>
          <figcaption>A new configuration file</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          In this one file, we specify three different FFT designs - an 8-point, 32-point and 128-point FFT. These designs also
          have different target densities, and to shorten the configuration file as much as possible, we can nest designs and
          have parameter definitions propagate from the top-level designs to more specific ones. Other than this, we specify a
          single pin configuration file for our designs, and we are ready to synthesize.
        </p>

        <figure style="max-width: min(70%, 300px)">
          <img src="imgs/DesigningAndSynthesizingABetterFFT/image5.png"/>
          <figcaption>An example <span class="code">pin_order.cfg</span></figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          To run synthesis, we type <span class="code">caravel src/fft/pease/fft.yml</span> and our designs are automatically
          synthesized in parallel, and the results will be copied to a build directory once synthesis completes. This
          streamlines our work process significantly, allowing us to push through the flow quickly and often, facilitating
          design correctness and optimization.
        </p>

        <p>
          The digital design process is characterized by many different incredibly powerful but difficult-to-master tools, and
          one of our biggest goals is to simplify this process and lower the learning curve so we as students are able to
          utilize these tools without needing years of experience in ASIC design and synthesis.
