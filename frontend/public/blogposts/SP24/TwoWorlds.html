        <p>
          ADCs serve as a bridge between the natural world (where signals occur in continuous
          time) and the digital domain (where signals occur in discrete time, with discrete
          amplitudes). They are an essential part of any sensing front-end, and will only grow in
          relevance with the continued deployment of edge-computing solutions as well as the
          continued push to place ADCs closer and closer to the front of the signal chain. This
          year, the analog subteam is taping-out two types of ADCs (flash and delta-sigma) in an
          effort to satisfy the needs of our campus partner, who requires a system that can
          convert the audio signals produced by a microphone into digital data. In this blog post,
          our goal is to provide a high-level overview of the three fundamental types of ADCs
          (delta-sigma, SAR, and flash) that exist and share our personal experiences designing
          delta-sigma and flash ADCs for the very first time.

        </p>
        <h2>Delta-Sigma ADCs:</h2>
        <p>
          Delta-Sigma ADCs offer high-resolution, low-noise conversion with a relatively small
          footprint. The topology of these circuits causes them to convert slower than other
          available ADC designs, but their numerous benefits make them a popular choice in
          many circuits. These ADCs use high-frequency oversampling in a feedback loop to
          modulate analog signals into a digital bit stream. This digital output is then fed into a
          digital filter, which obtains the signal in the frequency band of interest. Finally, a
          decimator is used to down-sample the high-frequency bit stream into a useful, high-
          resolution digital signal.
        </p>

          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          The front-end of the ADC, the modulator, is the heart of the Delta-Sigma. In a first-order
          design, as seen in Figure 1, the difference (delta) between the input analog signal and
          the digital feedback is fed into an integrator (sigma). The resistor and capacitor used in
          the integrator dictate the frequency cutoff of the modulator. The integrator then feeds
          into a clocked comparator. On every clock cycle of the oversampling frequency, the
          integrator signal is compared with the mid-rail voltage to produce a logical 1 or 0 on the
          digital output. The 1-bit DAC effectively acts as a level shifter to convert the logical
          output into voltages that are appropriate for the input signal amplitude.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/TwoWorlds/image2.png" />
          <figcaption><strong>Figure 2</strong><br>Waveforms of a Delta-Sigma Modulator [2]</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          The &quot;Latch&quot; wave in Figure 2 represents the desired output of the modulator. As the
          analog input rises in amplitude, the latch output spends more time as a 1. Conversely,
          as the input signal falls low, the latch output is favored toward 0. By averaging the digital
          signal, we can reconstruct the waveform of the analog input.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the primary appeals of the Delta-Sigma modulator is its noise-shaping ability. All
          ADCs face a problem called &quot;quantization noise.&quot; Since analog signals are continuous
          in time, while digital signals are discrete, there will be instances in which the analog
          input differs from the digital approximation. This difference is referred to as &quot;noise.&quot; Due
          to the oversampling rate of the Delta-Sigma, this noise is flattened across a greater frequency range, which
          is also
          pushed to higher frequencies by the high-pass filter
          effects on the noise. These effects can be visualized in Figure 3.
        </p>

            Filtering (b), and a Delta-Sigma ADC (c). [3]</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          By incorporating additional differentiation and integration stages, we can enhance the
          noise shaping ability of the ADC. Figure 4 illustrates the noise profiles of higher-order
          modulators. Increasing the modulation order and employing a larger oversampling ratio
          allows us to boost the effective bit resolution of the ADC. We intend to tape out a
          second-order ADC modulator this Spring, depicted in Figure 5. This design aims to
          achieve an effective output of 8 1/2 bits.

        <h2>Successive Approximation ADCs (SAR):</h2>

        <p>
          SAR ADCs are the most popular type of ADC when it comes to data-acquisition. They
          typically have resolutions ranging between 8 to 18 bits and sampling rates of a few
          MHz. As shown in Figure 6, the signal is first fed into a sample-and-hold circuit during
          the acquisition phase.The sample-and-hold circuit could be as simple as a switch
          followed by a RC circuit: 1) during acquisition, the switch is closed and the capacitor
          charges 2) during conversion, the switch opens and the voltage is stored on the
          capacitor.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/TwoWorlds/image6.png" />
          <figcaption><strong>Figure 6</strong><br> Block Diagram of a Basic SAR ADC [5]</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          During the actual conversion period itself, the DAC is initially set to mid-scale (MSB is
          set to 1, and the remaining bits are 0) and the comparator determines whether the
          sampled voltage is higher or lower than the mid-scale voltage. If the input voltage is
          indeed higher, then the MSB is kept as a 1; if not, the MSB is set to 0. Based on the outcome of this initial
          comparison, the DAC is then set to 1/4 scale or 3/4 scale - and the
          process continues. Fundamentally, the SAR ADC implements a binary search. Though
          this form of successive approximation allows SAR ADCs to achieve good accuracy,
          there is a significant trade off in speed as N-bit SAR ADCs typically require N
          conversion periods before another value can be sampled.
        </p>

        <p>
          Regarding the comparator, this block is typically designed to have an input referred
          noise that is lower than 1 LSB. The comparator's ability to resolve small voltage
          differences limits the overall accuracy of the system. Furthermore, the time it takes to
          resolve small voltage differences also limits the speed of a SAR ADC. One can imagine
          that a differential-pair-based comparator can resolve large voltage differences faster
          than small voltage differences since the former produces a significantly larger
          differential current than the latter.
        </p>

        <p>
          Regarding the DAC, this block is typically implemented using a bank of capacitors that
          are binary-weighted in value (a N-bit SAR ADC will have N binary-weighted caps and an
          additional cap for the dummy LSB). Though the use of unit capacitors can help with
          matching, capacitive DACs typically require calibration schemes. It is also worth noting
          that the setting time of the DAC also limits the speed of the SAR ADC.
        </p>

        <p>
          With all of these considerations in mind, it is not surprising that SAR ADCs are the go-to
          option in power-limited, area-limited applications. Fundamentally, SAR ADCs trade
          speed for resolution (and area). In retrospect, the analog sub-team should likely have
          designed a SAR ADC given the low-power, area-constrained nature of the bird-tag
          project (a potential project for next year!).
        </p>

        <h2>Flash ADCs:</h2>

        <p>
          Flash ADCs are perhaps the simplest and certainly the fastest type of ADC available.
          As shown in Figure 7, a simple N-bit flash ADC consists of 2 N equally-sized resistors
          (placed in a resistive ladder); 2 N parallel comparators; and a priority encoder. Each of
          the comparators compares the input signal against an equally-spaced reference voltage
          (a single voltage increment is equivalent to 1 LSB).
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/TwoWorlds/image7.png" />
          <figcaption><strong>Figure 7</strong><br>Block Diagram of a Basic Flash ADC [6]</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Based on the parallel nature of the architecture, we know the flash ADC is faster than
          typical delta-sigma and SAR ADCs. As compared to the SAR ADC that requires N
          comparison cycles, the flash ADC performs all of its voltage comparisons in parallel -
          and importantly, in a single cycle. That being said, it is also obvious that flash ADCs do
          not scale well due to the exponential nature of the required number of comparators and
          resistors (poor area and power scaling). Furthermore, this architecture exacerbates
          issues associated with mismatch and process variation. With these considerations in
          mind, it is not surprising that flash ADCs are typically limited to resolutions of 4 to 8 bits
          (with sampling rates reaching into the GHz range).
        </p>

        <p>
          To ease the power-speed tradeoff, comparators that consume zero static power can be
          utilized. One popular example of this would be the strongARM comparator, as shown in
          Figure 8. At a high level, the strongARM comparator is a dynamic, latched comparator.
          When CLK is low, the circuit pre-charges the output nodes (as well as various internal
          nodes to VDD). When CLK is high, the tail current transistor turns on; the differential
          pair generates a differential current; and the cross-coupled structures help pull the
          outputs to opposing rails (regeneration). One important thing to note about the strongARM comparator is that
          the
          threshold voltage of the input pair limits the full-scale
          voltage of the flash ADC. In other words, the common-mode voltage of the input signal
          lie above the input pair's threshold voltages since these devices must turn on in order to
          generate differential currents.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/TwoWorlds/image8.png" />
          <figcaption><strong>Figure 8</strong><br>A Basic strongARM Comparator</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Additionally, the strongARM comparator suffers from kick-back noise. During
          regeneration, large transient currents are drawn by the circuit. These currents couple
          back to the inputs through the parasitic Cgs and Cgd capacitors in MOSFET devices. In
          Figure 9, we show the effects of kick-back in a strongARM comparator circuit that we
          personally designed.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/TwoWorlds/image9.png" />
          <figcaption><strong>Figure 9</strong><br> Kick-back from a strongARM Comparator</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          The effects of kickback can be mitigated through the use of a pre-amplifier. The pre-
          amplifier acts as a buffer and lowers the input-referred kick-back noise by a factor equal
          to its gain. In Figure 10, we show a simple pre-amplifier that we designed. In Figure 11,
          we show how the aforementioned pre-amplifier reduces the kick-back noise generated
          by our strongARM comparator. However, it is important to note that our pre-amplifiers
          increase static power consumption (due to the amplifier's use of a tail-current transistor
          for current biasing) as well as overall area.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/TwoWorlds/image10.png" />

        </figure>

        <p>
          In the end, our team actually opted to use a low kick-back, class AB comparator. This
          type of latched comparator is similar to the strongARM comparator in the sense that it
          also leverages cross-coupled structures for regeneration. As shown in Figure 12, our
          low kick-back comparator has two transistors (M14 and M9) that essentially decouple
          the input differential pair from the regenerative nodes. Furthermore, the use of cross-
          coupled MOSCAPs helps neutralize unwanted current.
        </p>

          <figcaption><strong>Figure 12</strong><br>Kick-back Optimized Class AB Comparator</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Backing out to the system level, our team opted to design a 4-bit flash ADC. Initially, we
          were shooting for 5 to 6 bits. However, due to a lack of trust in Sky130's models, we
          were not confident if the provided mismatch parameters were accurate (Pelgrom's law).
          Hence, we selected 4-bits to be safe and increased the size of the input differential pair
          devices (in the comparators) to lower input-referred offset voltages. Furthermore, as
          shown in Figure 13, our flash ADC uses small resistor values in the resistive ladder to
          lower the impedance of those nodes and hence render those nodes less sensitive to
          kick-back (we used parallel segments to increase the area of the resistors to help with
          better matching). Additionally, one of our team member's designed optimized RS-
          latches that follow the output of the comparators. And lastly, one of our team's members
          designed the 16:4 priority encoder using Sky130's provided standard cells. The design
          is able to sample at frequencies above 25MHz whilst driving 20pF loads.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>

        <p>
          In engineering design, selecting the optimal ADC often hinges on the specific
          requirements of the application, rather than a one-size-fits-all solution. When prioritizing
          low noise and high resolution, the Delta Sigma ADC stands out as an excellent choice.
          For applications where power efficiency is paramount, the SAR ADC proves to be
          advantageous. On the other hand, if speed is a critical factor, opting for the flash ADC is
          a reliable approach. Ultimately, the best ADC selection depends on carefully weighing
          the unique needs and priorities of the given project. We hope that this post provides
          valuable insight into the realm of analog-to-digital converters!
