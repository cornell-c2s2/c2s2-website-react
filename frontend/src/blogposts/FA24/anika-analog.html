                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Anika and I am on the project management subteam of C2S2. This semester, I
                    expressed an interest in learning more about the analog subteam. More specifically, I learned
                    extensively about the Successive Approximative Register Analog-to-Digital Converter, otherwise known
                    as the SAR ADC. For reference, see Figure 1 below. A SAR ADC uses a binary search algorithm to
                    approximate an input voltage.
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="imgs/anika/image1.png" />
                    <figcaption><strong>Figure 1</strong><br>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    The team transitioned to a SAR ADC circuit for several reasons. First, they had several process and
                    constraint requirements. These include a 130 nm CMOS process, meaning that this required low power
                    and a low voltage process (1 v8). Another reason was that the area complexity scales were
                    proportional to the number of bits. On the other hand, a Flash ADC requires more comparators, is
                    more costly, and consumes more power, which is highly impractical for our circuit. Moreover, SAR
                    ADCs are more common, and provide higher resolution despite a lower area and lower power. As shown
                    in Figure 1, the Analog subteam constructed a chart comparing the SAR ADC to the Flash ADC and
                    Modulator from previous year, as well as their goal for the SAR.
                </p>

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    For more guidance on SAR ADC and its functions, I spoke with Daniel Kaminski ‘27 and Caden Xu ‘27 to
                    learn more. Caden Xu likened the SAR ADC to a scale, saying:
                </p>
                <p> <i>
                        “It’s like having a standard mass on one side and paper clips on the other. As you keep adding
                        paper
                        clips, it will eventually balance out. Same thing with SAR ADC. It takes your input voltage and
                        then
                        guesses a voltage, and then compares the two. If it guesses a voltage that is too high, it
                        lowers
                        that voltage. It continues approximating until it reaches the final value that the input voltage
                        is.”
                    </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The SAR ADC has several components: a Capacitive DAC (CDAC), a comparator, and analog switches.
                    First, the Successive Approximation Register (SAR) utilizes a binary search function and flip bits
                    from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB). After each flip, it checks
                    how the DAC voltage compares to the input voltage. It then changes the DAC input accordingly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next is the CDAC. Kaminiski tells us that the CDAC is used to convert a digital signal that is then
                    provided into a voltage. The layout of the CDAC is shown in Figure 3 below. The CDAC has a binary,
                    weighted 8 bit and differential configuration. This way, it reduces kickbacks (sudden, high spikes
                    in voltage) and constraints on charge injection. The CDAC operates by switching capacitor
                    connections. The layout of the CDAC is crucial for our circuit. First, the CDAC process variation
                    and parasitics has a profound impact on the effective number of bits (ENOB). When designing the
                    CDAC, the team had to keep their optimal layout for the overall SAR ADC in mind, as the CDAC had to
                    be thoroughly tested before the layout was designed.

                </p>

                    <figcaption><strong>Figure 3: CDAC Layout</strong><br>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    Another component is the comparator, which compares 2 signals together. It was designed so that it
                    is both accurate and has a resolution. The Analog subteam designed a Triple Tail Latched comparator,
                    as shown in the Figure 4 below. The Triple Comparator has several advantages, as it is a high speed
                    application, generates little to no noise, and performs well with low power consumption. It consists
                    of three stages: the preamplifier, the half-latch, and the latch. The preamplifier is responsible
                    for amplifying the differences between input signals, which allows the other stages to detect
                    differences in voltage. Next, the half-latch stage is the core of the comparator. It utilizes a
                    differential amplifier circuit with transistors to amplify the voltage difference given by the
                    preamplifier stage. Last is the latch stage, which provides a binary output based on the given
                    voltage difference from the half-latch stage.
                </p>

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>The last component is the analog switch, which switches the analog voltage to the capacitors. As
                    shown in Figure 5, the Analog team decided to implement a bootstrapped analog switch. This allows
                    for a selective switching between different analog signals. Furthermore, this design maintains a
                    constant Vgs and a constant-on resistance, thus minimizing any distortion caused by the switch’s
                    resistance changing with the input signal. Xu states that this lack of distortion is what makes it
                    perfect for ADCs, where he says “precision is key."
                </p>

                    <figcaption><strong>Figure 5: Bootstrapped Analog Switch</strong><br>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>After all of their hard work this semester, the Analog subteam has successfully implemented a
                    function 4 bit SAR ADC, which has a latched output and easier digital interfacing. In addition, the
                    high AMS simulation speed allows it to quickly iterate. This allows for a function simulation with
                    Verilog and synthesized logic when testing for transistor levels. Moreover, the Analog team says
                    that it is now possible to co-simulate this with the Digital Subteam, meaning that the full chip can
                    now be tested.
                </p>
                <p>Overall, the Analog subteam has showcased incredible growth and a steep learning curve. Simple
                    research of an interesting topic and the motivation to improve from previous designs has developed
                    into a remarkable final product. The SAR ADC is proof of the Analog subteam’s dedication and passion
                    for chip design, as they shape the future of chip design, one bit at a time.
