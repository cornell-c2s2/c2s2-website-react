        <p>
          What's up, everyone! My name is Tomas and I'm currently in the Digital subteam. During the fall, 
          I was in the Analog subteam. So, I've spent one semester doing analog schematic designs and another 
          working on digital blocks in Verilog. Even though the tools and technical knowledge that I used in 
          these two subteams were completely different, I found both of these experiences to be extremely valuable. 
        </p>

        <p>
          In the Analog subteam, I was assigned the task to design common source amplifiers. At the time, I had no 
          idea what an amplifier even looked like or what common source meant. It took a lot of reading and watching 
          videos to figure out the different equations that applied to mosfets. I used these equations to size the 
          components (e.g. resistors, voltage sources, mosfets) appropriately and obtain the gain wanted. Throughout 
          this process, I learned a lot of the intuitions behind how a change in one part of the circuit affected the 
          other parts. These relationships started becoming natural to me and the design process of new schematics 
          became easier each time. I also learned general sizing guidelines that I implemented into every design. For 
          example, mosfet devices should not be sized too small since they will be susceptible to noise while having a 
          device be too large is not ideal in a chip design scenario. Another guideline was that passive devices like 
          resistors and capacitors should be relatively larger since the smaller the device, the larger the percentage 
          error becomes. 
        </p>

        <p>
          In the Digital subteam, I have been working on a blocking crossbar implementation. This was very different work 
          because I was mostly working with Verilog code. Throughout the process of implementing this crossbar, I learned 
          a lot about the care that has to go into writing these modules since anything can go wrong in the real chip if 
          we are not too careful in the design phase. One of the strategies to ensure correct data processing was the latency 
          insensitive val/rdy protocol. The purpose of this protocol is to actively communicate with connected blocks to ensure 
          that the block is outputting the correct data. Any input or output message will have its own valid and ready bit. 
          An input message will be successfully sent from a previous block to the crossbar if the block sending that message 
          says it is a valid message and if the crossbar itself says that that input port is ready to receive a message. Output 
          messages work similarly, but, instead, the crossbar is the one outputting the valid bit while the block coming after it 
          will tell the crossbar if it is ready to receive the crossbar's output. These protocols are extremely necessary for the 
          chip functionality to come out as intended. 
        </p>

          One of the reasons I applied to C2S2 was that I wanted a source of 'accelerated learning'. I was very eager to learn and 
          solve all the mysteries that were bothering my mind regarding topics in ECE. I thought that if I took classes while 
          simultaneously being in a project team that applied those topics, I would learn at a rate faster than anyone else. In C2S2, 
          I was able to experience this 'accelerated learning' in two different forms. For the Analog subteam, I used the design 
          experience from C2S2 to better understand the applications behind the physics behind semiconductors information that I 
          learned in Microelectronics class. For the Digital subteam, I applied the theoretical knowledge behind combinational and 
          sequential logic blocks that I got from Digital Logic class into its Verilog implementation with timing and data loss 
          constraints in C2S2. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Hi, I'm Kevin Liu, one of the new C2S2 members and the youngest member on the Digital subteam. I plan to pursue a double-major 
          in CS and ECE, and am passionate about application-specific silicon design as a potential career path. Currently, my project 
          heavily involves how messages are sent between different modules of a chip, so I will be sharing some of the ways that this 
          can be accomplished.
        </p>

        <p>
          My project involves using the Wishbone Bus, an open-source bus design that has the potential to be very useful on the C2S2 chip. 
          If used on our FFT accelerator chip, it could, for example, allow much easier input of the FFT commands to the chip with less 
          precise timing and latency requirements. For now, I am in the process of building and simulating a simple proof-of-concept module 
          for the Wishbone Bus that will allow us to test and explore its behavior.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Wishbone specification is a handshake-based read/write cycle protocol where a master sends read/write instructions to a slave, 
          and the slave sends an 'acknowledge' signal once it is done processing the instruction. This ensures that the master never sends 
          instructions too fast for the slave to process. A diagram of the Wishbone interface is below. The Caravel harness includes a Wishbone 
          bus master, so I am creating a wishbone slave that will act as an interface to a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue. Writing to this 
          module will add data into the queue, and reading will extract from the front of the queue. This will allow meaningful testing of 
          read/write functionality. 
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/TwoSidesOfACoin/image3.png"/>
          <figcaption><strong>Figure 3</strong><br>Wishbone Interface</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          The queue uses a different communication protocol, called the val/rdy stream interface (meaning 'valid' and 'ready'). The protocol 
          connects a sender, which controls the valid signal, and a receiver which controls the ready signal. Every cycle, the sender sets the 
          valid signal to high if it is sending a valid data message along the data line. The receiver also sets the ready signal to high if 
          it is ready to receive a message from the data line. Both the sender and the receiver monitor both signals, and when they detect that 
          both are high, the message is considered to be successfully sent. Otherwise, if only the valid signal is high, it means that the sender 
          is sending the correct data but is waiting for the receiver to be ready for it. If only the ready signal is high, that means the receiver 
          is ready for a message and is waiting for the sender to send one and mark it as valid. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The Wishbone queue module needs to use two val/rdy interfaces: one for the queue to receive data (with the wishbone as the sender and 
          the queue as the reader), and one for the queue to send data (with the queue as the sender and the wishbone as the reader). The former 
          is through the ports prefixed by 'recv', and the latter is through the ports prefixed by 'send' on the queue, and all the connections of 
          my module are shown in the block diagram below. Most of the design of my module involved combinational logic to connect the wishbone 
          interface with the val/rdy interfaces appropriately. 
        </p>
