        <p>
          As a software engineer, abstraction is our best friend; limiting the scope of where we think about code is the
          key to
          productivity, not even considering the headache you might get when thinking about all the tools that help you
          in the
          background. We take this approach with our coding languages, but we often also utilize abstraction when
          compiling as
          well. Instead of manually running hundreds or thousands of commands to compile our software, we rely on build
          systems to
          keep track of our software and compile it for us. On C2S2, we use a couple build systems - but which one is
          best?
        </p>

        <h2>Makefiles</h2>

        <p>
          Makefiles are one of the first build systems to come around and are the backbone of many software programs.
          These are
          run using the <span class="courier-font"><strong>make</strong></span> command, and their popularity is shown
          by the fact that this command is mandated by POSIX (a common
          standard for operating systems, such as Linux and MacOS)
        </p>

        <p>
          Makefiles define how to build objects with rules; you would have a rule for each program you want to make.
          Each rule
          contains:
        </p>

        <ul style="justify-content: center;">
          <li>A target: The name of what you're trying to make</li>
          <li>Any prerequisites: Things we need in order to make our target</li>
          <li>A recipe: The list of commands that we need to run in order to make our target</li>
        </ul>



        <p>
          For example, the following code is a rule to build the target <span
            class="courier-font"><strong>hello.c</strong></span> from a prerequisite source file named hello.c using
          a recipe to compile using GCC:
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/CMake/image1.png" />
          <figcaption><strong>Figure 1</strong></figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          To see this actually in play, let's consider a "real-life" setup of a software project organization! The
          example below
          might show how our folders are organized; we have our main code in <span
            class="courier-font"><strong>main.cpp</strong></span>, and then some source code in the <span
            class="courier-font"><strong>src</strong></span>
          folder, which contains <span class="courier-font"><strong>src.hpp</strong></span> and <span
            class="courier-font"><strong>src.cpp</strong></span> (don't worry too much if those file names aren't too
          familiar - we just want
          to understand how we might compile them)
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/CMake/image2.png" />
          <figcaption><strong>Figure 2</strong></figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          If we're compiling these with Makefiles, we might have to have rules for how to compile both the code in the
          <span class="courier-font"><strong>src</strong></span> folder
          (for C++, this would compile to a <span class="courier-font"><strong>src.o</strong></span>), as well as the
          main code (into a program named <span class="courier-font"><strong>prog</strong></span>) using <span
            class="courier-font"><strong>src.o</strong></span>:
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/CMake/image3.png" />
          <figcaption><strong>Figure 3</strong></figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          The downside here is that our current system doesn't scale well - you'd have to define a whole new rule for
          every file
          you add! Instead, Makefiles allow us to define pattern rules to specify a rule for how to build a specific
          type of file:
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/CMake/image4.png" />
          <figcaption><strong>Figure 4</strong></figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Here, we specify that <span class="courier-font"><strong>prog</strong></span> depends on all of the object
          files listed in <span class="courier-font"><strong>OBJECT_FILES</strong></span> (in this case, only <span
            class="courier-font"><strong>src.o</strong></span> ).
          Additionally, we use the % wildcard to make a rule for how to make any .o file. This gives our Makefile a lot
          more
          flexibility and avoids repeating rules. We could build our code using the command <span
            class="courier-font"><strong>make prog</strong></span> , which will run the recipe
          for the <span class="courier-font"><strong>prog</strong></span> command (building our program!)
        </p>

        <p>
          However, we still have to specify all of the source files currently in <span
            class="courier-font"><strong>OBJECT_FILES</strong></span>; while there are ways around this,
          they're often confusing and hard to understand. We also rely on a very specific organization structure (with
          all of the
          source files in the src folder); if we were to include other folder structures, such as when working with
          other
          projects, this may not work well.
        </p>

        <h2>CMake</h2>

        <p>
          On the other hand, we could also choose to build our project using CMake. CMake is a build system that allows
          developers
          to build their projects across multiple different environments with only one set of files. Additionally, CMake
          has many
          other built-in tools that allow for further functionality such as cross-platform testing.
        </p>

        <p>
          We can demonstrate this by using the same folder structure as above. We begin by creating a file named <span
            class="courier-font"><strong>CMakeLists.txt</strong></span> in
          the root of the project. All of our CMake code will be written in this file. To start, we need to write some
          boilerplate
          code that will set the CMake version, name the current project, and specify the C++ version:
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/CMake/image5.png" />
          <figcaption><strong>Figure 5</strong></figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Next, we need to allow the CMake project to see the <span class="courier-font"><strong>src</strong></span>
          folder. To do this, we can create a new <span class="courier-font"><strong>CMakeLists.txt</strong></span>
          within
          the src folder, which contains the line <span class="courier-font"><strong>add_library(src
              src.cpp)</strong></span>, to tell CMake that we have a library that our software
          can use named src (including the code in <span class="courier-font"><strong>src.cpp</strong></span>) Now, we
          return to the <span class="courier-font"><strong>CMakeLists.txt</strong></span> file in the project root and
          add
          the line <span class="courier-font"><strong>add_subdirectory(src)</strong></span> which as the name suggests
          allows the greater CMake project to see the src folder
          (folders are sometimes called "directories") and include its files (namely the header file <span
            class="courier-font"><strong>src.hpp</strong></span>, as well as our src
          library code) when compiling.
        </p>


        <p>
          Finally, we can get to creating the program <span class="courier-font"><strong>prog</strong></span> which will
          be used, as seen above, to actually run the code in
          <span class="courier-font"><strong>main.cpp</strong></span>. To set this up, we have the following code:
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/CMake/image6.png" />
          <figcaption><strong>Figure 6</strong></figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          The first thing that happens here is the creation of a new executable (another word for "program") called
          <span class="courier-font"><strong>prog</strong></span> which is
          built from the main program in <span class="courier-font"><strong>main.cpp</strong></span>. We then link the
          <span class="courier-font"><strong>src</strong></span> library to this executable, so that it can use the code
          contained in the <span class="courier-font"><strong>src</strong></span> folder.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now that we have written our CMake code, we can actually build our project! First, we create a new folder
          called <span class="courier-font"><strong>build</strong></span>
          in the main root of our project (CMake actually does not care where this <span
            class="courier-font"><strong>build</strong></span> folder is, but by convection, we put it
          here). Now, we move into the <span class="courier-font"><strong>build</strong></span> folder and run the
          following commands:
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/CMake/image7.png" />
          <figcaption><strong>Figure 7</strong></figcaption>
        </figure>


        <p>
          The first command <span class="courier-font"><strong>(cmake ..)</strong></span> goes through our CMake files
          and generates supporting code to help build our project (under
          the hood, it creates a super-complicated Makefile to build our code!). Then, <span
            class="courier-font"><strong>make prog</strong></span> will build the program using the
          generated Makefile, similar to before. Now we're finally done, and can run our program, just the same as with
          Makefiles!
        </p>

        <h2>Tradeoffs</h2>

        <p>
          After exploring both CMake and Makefiles, we can come away with some concrete tradeoffs that may help to
          inform you
          which build system may be worth investing in for your project!
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Startup Cost:</strong> Makefiles are relatively easy to get started with; all you need to specify
            is the rules you want, nothing else! In
            contrast, CMake requires some boilerplate code to get started, including CMake files in sub-folders,
            increasing the
            barrier between you and your first compilation.</li>
          <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Makefiles may quickly become hard to scale; handling complicated folder
            structures may prove difficult, as well as
            keeping track of different projects and parts of compilation. You may also have to edit the Makefile as you
            add more
            files, adding one more step in your development workflow. In contrast, CMake build structures have a variety
            of commands
            for working with complicated build structures, and can also easily integrate with each other, making it
            relatively easy
            to include other projects that also use CMake. While our example also manually specified the files we use
            for
            simplicity, CMake also can help easily detect the files present in your folders, meaning you don't have to
            edit them
            every time you add new code.</li>
          <li><strong>Syntax:</strong> Lastly, an important attribute of code is how understandable it is! The syntax of
            Makefiles can quickly get confusing
            and isn't necessarily intuitive for others to pick up and understand at a glance (looking back at the code
            above, would
            it have made sense without explanation?). However, CMake makes use of intuitive, human-readable function
            names and code,
            making it a lot easier to tell what's going on at a glance.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Because of all of these, Makefiles are best for quick pieces of code; if your project is small, and you just
          want to
          avoid running a few commands over and over again, Makefiles can help automate these away. However, if you're
          starting a
          large piece of software, it's worthwhile to invest in CMake; while it takes a little more to start up, its
          scalability
          will prove worthwhile overall.
        </p>
