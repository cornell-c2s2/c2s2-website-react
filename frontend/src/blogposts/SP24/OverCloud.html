          Over the last year, C2S2 has been developing a bird tag system for the Lab of Ornithology. Specifically, the System
          Architecture subteam has been involved in determining the system required to successfully execute the project with the
          Lab of Ornithology.
        </p>

        <figure>

          <figcaption><strong>Figure 1</strong><br> System diagram for the Bird Tag</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          One of the primary goals for the System Architecture subteam is to find a method of offloading data from the Bird Tag to
          a docking station. We considered various methods of offloading data wirelessly to the cloud, ranging from WiFi to
          Bluetooth to Radio-Frequency Communication.
        </p>

        <p>
          In order to explore how over-the-cloud communication works, we decided to use a commercial Wifi-development kit, the
          Particle Argon. The Particle Argon is a microcontroller board designed for IoT projects, with integrated WiFi
          connectivity and a suite of features including onboard sensors, libraries, and cloud integration. This combination of
          capabilities simplifies the development process for IoT applications. The built-in WiFi functionality of the Particle
          Argon is particularly valuable for understanding how to transmit data from the Bird Tag to cloud-based platforms without
          physical connections.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Particle Board is a programmable device. In order to program it, there is a Web IDE which can be used and that
          supports over-the-cloud flashing of programs. It supports programming in Arduino and C++. We added a Lithium polymer
          battery to the board so we could use it wirelessly, and we also connected a Temperature and Humidity sensor to it.
          Lastly, we enclosed the whole system in a box to allow for movement. Figure 2 shows the complete setup.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/OverCloud/image2.png"/>
          <figcaption><strong>Figure 2</strong><br>The Particle Argon enclosed in a casing with its battery inside the box and the Temperature sensor attached on the lid of the box</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Over the course of our work so far, we created multiple programs to explore what we could do with the Particle board. In
          this post, we hope to share three primary programs. First, we want to share our process of reading data from the
          temperature sensor. Next, we'll discuss how we created a program to blink an LED through a phone. Lastly, we'll explain
          the process of publish and subscribe, and how we used that to make two Particle boards interact with each other.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our first program is designed to read temperature and humidity data from a Grove Temperature and Humidity Sensor
          connected to the board. In order to use the sensors and the LEDs, we first set up the pins that they are connected to.
          We continuously collect temperature and humidity values from the sensor, format them, and "publish" them to the Particle
          Cloud every second. This code essentially retrieves sensor data and sends it to the cloud periodically, allowing for
          remote monitoring and analysis of temperature and humidity levels.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next is our over-the-cloud blinky program which is designed to control an LED using remote commands through the Particle
          Cloud. The setup initializes the LED pin as an output and establishes a Particle function named "led" that triggers the
          toggle() function. This function listens for commands like "on", "off", or "blink" sent through the Particle Cloud. When
          the function receives a command, the toggle() function executes the corresponding action: turning the LED on (HIGH), off
          (LOW), or making it blink for a few cycles. If an unrecognized command is received, the function returns an error code.
          This setup demonstrates how to remotely control hardware using Particle Cloud functions, providing a simple interface to
          interact with physical devices connected to the Particle Argon.
        </p>

        <p>
          In our next program, our goal was to create a system in which pressing a physical button would trigger an event through
          one Particle board, leading to a change in the state of an LED on another Particle board. In order to make this work,
          both of the devices must be connected to the same WiFi network and they need to be added to the same account on the
          Particle Sandbox. To program this functionality, we had to create two different files, one for each device. The first
          file sets up one Particle board to detect a button press and publish a "toggle-led" message to the cloud when the button
          is pressed. The second file sets up the other Particle board to perform an action when the "toggle-led" message is
          received. Specifically, when the message is received, the LED on the second board toggles its state.
        </p>

        <p>
          These are just a few of the programs that we have programmed on the particle board. Although simple, these programs are
          the building blocks of our more recent work, in which we save the data collected from a sensor onto memory, so that we
          can transfer files instead of continuous messages. We have been able to collect temperature and humidity sensor data and
          store that onto a file. Our next goal is to collect data from an external microphone, save this data onto a file, and
          then transfer it to a computer over the cloud. In doing so, we hope to replicate a small subset of what the whole bird
          tag system is supposed to do.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall, our work with the particle board attempts to simulate the overall bird tag system. Specifically, we are hoping
          to understand how over-the-cloud communication works and how we can implement some of the Particle board's functions
          onto our software and PCB designs in the future.
