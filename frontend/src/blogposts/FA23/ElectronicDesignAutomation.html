          The process of producing an integrated circuit involves a meticulous process and knowledge in a variety of tasks:
          creating a high-level description, synthesizing a netlist of logic gates, performing physical design with placement
          and routing, and validating the design through simulation and verification at various points in this process. More
          than half a decade ago, all of these tasks would have to be manually carried out. Now, could you imagine performing
          these steps for today's billion transistor chips? Half a decade ago, this may seem like an impossible task. However,
          with the development of electronic design automation (EDA) tools, the modern electronic design industry is equipped
          with tools and methodologies that enhance design efficiency, reduce time and costs, and enable significantly more
          complex silicon systems. In this blog post, we will discuss how EDA tools impact C2S2's design process and the future
          of EDA tools in research trends.

          What exactly does EDA encompass? EDA is a category of software tools that help us design electronic systems, ranging
          from application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) to printed circuit boards (PCBs). Most members on our team work
          with EDA tools in one way or another. The PCB design software used by the System Architecture team, the various analog
          circuit simulations performed by the Analog team, and the automated digital design flow used by the Digital team are
          all examples of EDA tools. The algorithms that perform static timing analysis and routing are examples as well. These
          tools allow C2S2 to execute fast paced designs. Members are able to perform simulations and validate blocks early in
          the year without a significant time bottleneck, thus enabling us to design complex hardware in a hierarchical manner.
        </p>

        <p>
          Further, with these tools in hand, we are able to abstract away hardware details and design on various abstraction
          levels. EDA tools are able to take various abstractions, such as in the figure below, and transform them into designs
          in file formats that we can then send to a PCB manufacturer or ASIC foundry. The power of abstraction greatly assists
          C2S2 in performing undergraduate semiconductor design by modeling complex systems, facilitating hierarchical design
          with well-defined modules, and simplifying the complexity of the design process.

        </figure>

        <p>
          In addition to its ability to streamline the design process, EDA tools give us the actual hardware we are designing,
          in terms of transistor models. The development of EDA tools is tightly coupled with the development of process nodes.
          The properties of a specific semiconductor foundry are encoded in a set of files which make up a process design kit
          (PDK). C2S2 uses the open source SkyWater SKY130 PDK. The information stored in the PDK libraries, such as transistor
          size or timing characteristics, allow us to perform simulations and test our circuits to make sure they meet
          specifications before tapeout.
        </p>

        <p>
          Apart from EDA tools that are used for hardware synthesis, as discussed above, research trends in the field have
          involved the development of languages and compilers that can generate hardware descriptions. In particular, high-level
          synthesis (HLS) toolchains transform a programming language functional description into low-level RTL code. One of the
          most well-known examples of an HLS toolchain is Vitis HLS, which compiles C++ programs to Verilog. While use of Vitis
          HLS is quite widespread in academia and industry, the last several years have also seen the emergence of more research
          projects that seek to answer the question of how we can leverage programming abstractions to make hardware design
          easier and more efficient. Google's open-source XLS toolchain is one such example, and is particularly exciting given
          its potential for use on C2S2.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
          The goal of XLS is to provide software and hardware engineers with the tools they need to develop specialized
          hardware. XLS has two frontends, C++ and a novel language called DSLX, which was developed specifically for use in
          XLS. Given a program in C++ or DSLX, the XLS compiler builds an intermediate representation (IR). Many HLS toolchains
          use an intermediate representation that is based on a control-flow graph, which is a representation common in typical
          software compilers because it models the sequential execution of a program. However, this model is limited in its
          ability to represent hardware designs, in which many computations can occur in parallel. For this reason, the XLS
          compiler opts instead to use an IR that is closer to a 'sea of nodes' model, which has less of a rigid hierarchical
          structure than a control-flow graph.

          With the IR built, the XLS compiler performs a series of optimizations on it, many of which are typical compiler
          passes and some of which are specific to compilers that generate hardware descriptions. For example, the compiler
          performs dead code elimination, which removes unreachable nodes from the IR. Another common pass that the XLS compiler
          implements is constant folding, which has the potential to eliminate computational complexity from the IR. For
          example, if an arithmetic expression has only constants as inputs, the compiler is able to compute its value at
          compile time, rather than runtime (in this case, the "runtime" is the execution of the hardware). From here, the
          compiler performs many application-specific optimizations, which are targeted at generating the most efficient
          hardware descriptions possible. There are quite a lot of them, and they are detailed 
          <a href="https://google.github.io/xls/optimizations/optimizations/#narrowing-optimizations">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          A key part of the XLS toolchain is its ability to create schedules for the hardware it generates. When we design
          hardware, we often want to pipeline our designs. The XLS toolchain allows programmers to simply write a high-level
          description of a program, in which all notions of its underlying hardware or timing behavior are abstracted away.
          Then, the XLS compiler generates and pipelines the design using scheduling algorithms. The goal of this phase of the
          compiler is to determine the clock period of the design, and then find a schedule that minimizes resource usage while
          still meeting timing.

        </figure>

        <p>
          On C2S2, we have been experimenting with using XLS to generate some of our hardware blocks. For example, XLS has a
          parameterized floating point library implemented in DSLX, which can be used for our own modules that require floating
          point math. Using XLS for cases such as this would enable us to build more interesting and complex blocks without
          getting stuck in the low-level details of implementing a floating point library ourselves by hand. Additionally, using
          XLS would allow us to parameterize our designs over pipeline depth, so that we can have multiple blocks which compute
          the same operations but have different timing behavior, based on the specific use case of what we may want on the
          chip.
