                    <p>
                        As a software engineer, abstraction is our best friend; limiting the scope of where we think about code is the
                        key to
                        productivity, not even considering the headache you might get when thinking about all the tools that help you
                        in the
                        background. We take this approach with our coding languages, but we often also utilize abstraction when
                        compiling as
                        well. Instead of manually running hundreds or thousands of commands to compile our software, we rely on build
                        systems to
                        keep track of our software and compile it for us. On C2S2, we use a couple build systems - but which one is
                        best?
                    </p>

                    <h2>Makefiles</h2>

                    <p>
                        Makefiles are one of the first build systems to come around and are the backbone of many software programs.
                        These are
                        run using the <span className="courier-font"><strong>make</strong></span> command, and their popularity is shown
                        by the fact that this command is mandated by POSIX (a common
                        standard for operating systems, such as Linux and MacOS)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Makefiles define how to build objects with rules; you would have a rule for each program you want to make.
                        Each rule
                        contains:
                    </p>

                    <ul style="justify-content: center;">
                        <li>A target: The name of what you're trying to make</li>
                        <li>Any prerequisites: Things we need in order to make our target</li>
                        <li>A recipe: The list of commands that we need to run in order to make our target</li>
                    </ul>



                    <p>
                        For example, the following code is a rule to build the target <span
                            className="courier-font"><strong>hello.c</strong></span> from a prerequisite source file named hello.c using
                        a recipe to compile using GCC:
                    </p>

                    <figure>
                        <img src={image1} />
                        <figcaption><strong>Figure 1</strong></figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        To see this actually in play, let's consider a "real-life" setup of a software project organization! The
                        example below
                        might show how our folders are organized; we have our main code in <span
                            className="courier-font"><strong>main.cpp</strong></span>, and then some source code in the <span
                                className="courier-font"><strong>src</strong></span>
                        folder, which contains <span className="courier-font"><strong>src.hpp</strong></span> and <span
                            className="courier-font"><strong>src.cpp</strong></span> (don't worry too much if those file names aren't too
                        familiar - we just want
                        to understand how we might compile them)
                    </p>

                    <figure>
                        <img src={image2} />
                        <figcaption><strong>Figure 2</strong></figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        If we're compiling these with Makefiles, we might have to have rules for how to compile both the code in the
                        <span className="courier-font"><strong>src</strong></span> folder
                        (for C++, this would compile to a <span className="courier-font"><strong>src.o</strong></span>), as well as the
                        main code (into a program named <span className="courier-font"><strong>prog</strong></span>) using <span
                            className="courier-font"><strong>src.o</strong></span>:
                    </p>

                    <figure>
                        <img src={image3} />
                        <figcaption><strong>Figure 3</strong></figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        The downside here is that our current system doesn't scale well - you'd have to define a whole new rule for
                        every file
                        you add! Instead, Makefiles allow us to define pattern rules to specify a rule for how to build a specific
                        type of file:
                    </p>

                    <figure>
                        <img src={image4} />
                        <figcaption><strong>Figure 4</strong></figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        Here, we specify that <span className="courier-font"><strong>prog</strong></span> depends on all of the object
                        files listed in <span className="courier-font"><strong>OBJECT_FILES</strong></span> (in this case, only <span
                            className="courier-font"><strong>src.o</strong></span> ).
                        Additionally, we use the % wildcard to make a rule for how to make any .o file. This gives our Makefile a lot
                        more
                        flexibility and avoids repeating rules. We could build our code using the command <span
                            className="courier-font"><strong>make prog</strong></span> , which will run the recipe
                        for the <span className="courier-font"><strong>prog</strong></span> command (building our program!)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        However, we still have to specify all of the source files currently in <span
                            className="courier-font"><strong>OBJECT_FILES</strong></span>; while there are ways around this,
                        they're often confusing and hard to understand. We also rely on a very specific organization structure (with
                        all of the
                        source files in the src folder); if we were to include other folder structures, such as when working with
                        other
                        projects, this may not work well.
                    </p>

                    <h2>CMake</h2>

                    <p>
                        On the other hand, we could also choose to build our project using CMake. CMake is a build system that allows
                        developers
                        to build their projects across multiple different environments with only one set of files. Additionally, CMake
                        has many
                        other built-in tools that allow for further functionality such as cross-platform testing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We can demonstrate this by using the same folder structure as above. We begin by creating a file named <span
                            className="courier-font"><strong>CMakeLists.txt</strong></span> in
                        the root of the project. All of our CMake code will be written in this file. To start, we need to write some
                        boilerplate
                        code that will set the CMake version, name the current project, and specify the C++ version:
                    </p>

                    <figure>
                        <img src={image5} />
                        <figcaption><strong>Figure 5</strong></figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        Next, we need to allow the CMake project to see the <span className="courier-font"><strong>src</strong></span>
                        folder. To do this, we can create a new <span className="courier-font"><strong>CMakeLists.txt</strong></span>
                        within
                        the src folder, which contains the line <span className="courier-font"><strong>add_library(src
                            src.cpp)</strong></span>, to tell CMake that we have a library that our software
                        can use named src (including the code in <span className="courier-font"><strong>src.cpp</strong></span>) Now, we
                        return to the <span className="courier-font"><strong>CMakeLists.txt</strong></span> file in the project root and
                        add
                        the line <span className="courier-font"><strong>add_subdirectory(src)</strong></span> which as the name suggests
                        allows the greater CMake project to see the src folder
                        (folders are sometimes called "directories") and include its files (namely the header file <span
                            className="courier-font"><strong>src.hpp</strong></span>, as well as our src
                        library code) when compiling.
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        Finally, we can get to creating the program <span className="courier-font"><strong>prog</strong></span> which will
                        be used, as seen above, to actually run the code in
                        <span className="courier-font"><strong>main.cpp</strong></span>. To set this up, we have the following code:
                    </p>

                    <figure>
                        <img src={image6} />
                        <figcaption><strong>Figure 6</strong></figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        The first thing that happens here is the creation of a new executable (another word for "program") called
                        <span className="courier-font"><strong>prog</strong></span> which is
                        built from the main program in <span className="courier-font"><strong>main.cpp</strong></span>. We then link the
                        <span className="courier-font"><strong>src</strong></span> library to this executable, so that it can use the code
                        contained in the <span className="courier-font"><strong>src</strong></span> folder.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now that we have written our CMake code, we can actually build our project! First, we create a new folder
                        called <span className="courier-font"><strong>build</strong></span>
                        in the main root of our project (CMake actually does not care where this <span
                            className="courier-font"><strong>build</strong></span> folder is, but by convection, we put it
                        here). Now, we move into the <span className="courier-font"><strong>build</strong></span> folder and run the
                        following commands:
                    </p>

                    <figure>
                        <img src={image7} />
                        <figcaption><strong>Figure 7</strong></figcaption>
                    </figure>


                    <p>
                        The first command <span className="courier-font"><strong>(cmake ..)</strong></span> goes through our CMake files
                        and generates supporting code to help build our project (under
                        the hood, it creates a super-complicated Makefile to build our code!). Then, <span
                            className="courier-font"><strong>make prog</strong></span> will build the program using the
                        generated Makefile, similar to before. Now we're finally done, and can run our program, just the same as with
                        Makefiles!
                    </p>

                    <h2>Tradeoffs</h2>

                    <p>
                        After exploring both CMake and Makefiles, we can come away with some concrete tradeoffs that may help to
                        inform you
                        which build system may be worth investing in for your project!
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Startup Cost:</strong> Makefiles are relatively easy to get started with; all you need to specify
                            is the rules you want, nothing else! In
                            contrast, CMake requires some boilerplate code to get started, including CMake files in sub-folders,
                            increasing the
                            barrier between you and your first compilation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Makefiles may quickly become hard to scale; handling complicated folder
                            structures may prove difficult, as well as
                            keeping track of different projects and parts of compilation. You may also have to edit the Makefile as you
                            add more
                            files, adding one more step in your development workflow. In contrast, CMake build structures have a variety
                            of commands
                            for working with complicated build structures, and can also easily integrate with each other, making it
                            relatively easy
                            to include other projects that also use CMake. While our example also manually specified the files we use
                            for
                            simplicity, CMake also can help easily detect the files present in your folders, meaning you don't have to
                            edit them
                            every time you add new code.</li>
                        <li><strong>Syntax:</strong> Lastly, an important attribute of code is how understandable it is! The syntax of
                            Makefiles can quickly get confusing
                            and isn't necessarily intuitive for others to pick up and understand at a glance (looking back at the code
                            above, would
                            it have made sense without explanation?). However, CMake makes use of intuitive, human-readable function
                            names and code,
                            making it a lot easier to tell what's going on at a glance.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Because of all of these, Makefiles are best for quick pieces of code; if your project is small, and you just
                        want to
                        avoid running a few commands over and over again, Makefiles can help automate these away. However, if you're
                        starting a
                        large piece of software, it's worthwhile to invest in CMake; while it takes a little more to start up, its
                        scalability
                        will prove worthwhile overall.
