                    <p>
                        System Architecture has been doing a bit of exploration and discovery this semester. Since the beginning of C2S2,we have
                        been strictly using Altium Designer as our PCB Design Tool of choice. However, after having some conversations and
                        reflecting on the nature of this team we decided it was prudent to see other software and compare it to Altium. We chose
                        KiCad and we are going to do a quick comparison of our initial thoughts of each tool and see which one aligns more with
                        your needs.
                    </p>

                    <p>There are multiple PCB Design Tools or EDA Tools available on the market. The most notable being Altium Designer, OrCAD
                        and Allegro, EAGLE and KiCad. These softwares help with schematic design and capture,creating component footprints,
                        layout design, implementing design rule checks (DRCs) and more. These are all important aspects of the design process so
                        it is important to choose a tool that works for you.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Accessibility</h2>

                    <h3>Altium</h3>
                    <p>Altium Designer is a commercial PCB design software that comes with various subscription based licensing options. The
                        perpetual license cost is 11,970 USD and the term-based license is 355 USD per month. However they do provide free
                        annual licenses to students. Although Altium's software may be free for students, accessibility may be difficult for
                        those who want access to PCB design software outside of an academic setting. In addition, Altium Designer is mainly
                        intended for Windows, but it can run on macOS using virtual machines.</p>

                    <h3>KiCad</h3>
                    <p>KiCad is an Open Source EDA tool that is available for download on Windows, macOS and Linux. It is mostly used by
                        electronic hobbyists and inexperienced users as it is free to the general public. It is part of their mission statement
                        to balance between keeping the software approachable to new users but still having complex design features for
                        professional users.
                    </p>

                    <h2>User-Interface</h2>

                    <h3>Altium</h3>

                    <p>Altium's user interface may be daunting for beginners as there are many panels or options to choose from. However, once
                        you overcome the steep learning curve, you can utilize its large library of components that exist in the real world!
                        This is a major advantage of Altium because it avoids the hassle of searching for datasheets, and it neglects the need
                        to check whether a component is in stock or not.
                    </p>

                    <figure>
                        <img src={image1} />
                        <figcaption><strong>Figure 1</strong><br />Here is the schematic layout of a Battery Voltage Monitor Circuit</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>As you can see from above, Altium labels each component with its part number corresponding to the part manufacturer.
                        Aside from that difference, the general layout of the schematic is similar to KiCad.
                    </p>

                    <figure>
                        <img src={image2} />
                        <figcaption><strong>Figure 2</strong><br />Here is the PCB Layout of Battery Voltage Monitor Circuit</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>Importing the footprints from the schematic is very straightforward due to the fact that Altium has footprints
                        associated with most of the manufactured parts. Notably, Altium has an auto router which can be used to assist users
                        with routing. However, Altium's interface for routing is simple enough for anyone to learn.
                    </p>

                    <h3>KiCad</h3>
                    <p>KiCad is a bit more user friendly than Altium and sets a lot of things up for you on the jump. When you create a new
                        project, it automatically opens a schematic file and a layout file. From there, you can place and wire the symbols you
                        need for your project. One thing to note is that there isn't a default footprint to each symbol so make sure you select
                        the part or else there will be no footprint for layout.
                    </p>

                    <figure>
                        <img src={image3} />
                        <figcaption><strong>Figure 3</strong><br />Here is the schematic of the same Battery Voltage Monitor Circuit</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>As you can see, the schematics look similar but are using different symbols. KiCad has a bunch of shortcuts that are
                        more intuitive than Altium. Everything you need to draw your schematic is on the right side of the screen and as seen in
                        the picture the cursor is the intersection of two lines to make sure that when you place components or wires everything
                        is well aligned. This makes KiCad slightly easier to use when designing compared to Altium.
                    </p>

                    <figure>
                        <img src={image4} />
                        <figcaption><strong>Figure 4</strong><br />Here is the PCB Layout of the same Battery Voltage Monitor Circuit</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>Just like in Altium, all the reference numbers and component names are transferred over from the schematic. Another cool
                        feature is that when you draw a trace to connect one pin to another it highlights where it should go. This is extremely
                        useful as your projects get more complicated, it gets harder to see where to route the traces.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Overall Features</h2>

                    <h3>Altium</h3>
                    <p>There are an extensive number of features that Altium supports. As mentioned before, Altium has a comprehensive set of
                        manufactured part libraries which streamlines the process of searching for the vendors, datasheets, and part design
                        (both 3D and 2D). Altium also supports a 3D viewing tool which allows users to view their design in a spatial format
                        that's easier to visualize than the traditional 2D layout. Another feature of Altium is Simulation and Analysis which
                        allows users to perform signal and power analysis of their analog and digital circuits. This feature allows users to
                        identify issues with their circuit before it is manufactured. The most helpful feature of Altium is the ability to
                        collaborate with other people on designs. Altium utilizes a GIT system that can allow users to commit to the same
                        project, and version control. Lastly, the documentation feature of Altium makes it convenient for users to compile
                        resources such as assembly drawings and bill of materials (BOM) to support the fabrication and assembly processes.
                    </p>

                    <h3>KiCad</h3>
                    <p>KiCad also has features unique to its platform. A really cool one is that it is integrated with SPICE (Simulation
                        Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) Simulation. One can create a schematic in KiCad and select parameters for your
                        project. Then you can simulate it to see if you are getting your desired output. This saves a lot of time and money
                        fabricating a prototype that doesn't work as designed. KiCad also has a thriving community of users and thorough
                        documentation that are available if you have questions or need assistance. One can also download plugins to automate
                        design tasks like autorouting, an interactive BOM (Bill of Materials) generator and quick order buttons to various PCB
                        manufacturers.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>Altiumely (Ultimately), the choice is yours depending on what you prioritize when designing your PCBs. Altium Designer
                        is an expensive commercial product designed for industrial use, but offers numerous features and a sleek user interface
                        that one can learn over time. It can be very helpful for those looking to do more complex and professional PCB
                        designs.On the other hand, KiCad is an open source and readily accessible tool that also carries similar features and
                        functionality to Altium in an intuitive user interface . However, KiCad may be inconvenient for hobbyist designers who
                        plan to often send their designs to PCB fabrication plants as KiCad does not offer extensive component libraries from
                        different manufacturers with the datasheets readily available. In the world of PCB design, the software skills are
                        transferable so whatever you choose, you're one step closer to becoming a PCB designer.
