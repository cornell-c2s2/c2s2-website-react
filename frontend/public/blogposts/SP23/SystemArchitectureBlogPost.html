        <p>
          Hi! I am Akshati and I am on C2S2's System Architecture sub-team. With the introduction of 
          our new campus partner, the Lab of Ornithology, the system architecture sub-team has recently 
          been involved in determining the system requirements and constraints for this project. 
        </p>

        <p>
          We are working with Christopher Tarango at the Lab of Ornithology who is researching the 
          movement of Scrub Jays and how their movement is associated with the bird's vocalization. In 
          his past work, Tarango has bought tags and has connected an external Pipistrelle (for audio 
          recording) and an external inertial motion recorder to the tag, and has soldered batteries 
          onto the tag; this setup costs him around $1400. Currently, Tarango's batteries last for ~17 
          hours and the battery's capacity drops drastically over time. Additionally, he needs some sort 
          of waterproofing for the tag to ensure that they are safe from the rain; we do need to ensure, 
          however, that they do not create noise and interfere with the microphone on the tag. There is 
          also a weight constraint associated with this project since, according to the 5% rule, the 
          birds' behavior might be affected if something that is heavier than 5% of their weight is added 
          to their body for long periods of time; this means that the tag on the Scrub Jays should weigh 
          around five grams. We therefore hope to create a bird tag with the goal of improving the length 
          of deployment and reducing birds' stress from tagging.
        </p>

        <p>
          In order to design this tagging device, we have been determining the system requirements and have 
          been planning/researching potential implementations. For weatherproofing, we have been looking at 
          thermo-contractile sleeves, specifically the non-metallic ones, since we are also looking at wireless 
          communication for easier data transfer (discussed later) and having a metallic covering would result 
          in a Faraday's cage. Additionally, we will be needing a microphone in the tagger to record bird 
          vocalizations. We are thinking of implementing one or both of these two ideas for the microphone: 
          first, we could have a better quality microphone that picks up all noises that the bird makes and 
          encounters; second, C2S2's software sub-team could work on a noise-reduction mechanism that would allow 
          for Tarango to have the noise-reduced data to analyze. We also need an IMU (inertial measurement unit) 
          to get data for the movement of the bird. We would need a power delivery port in order to charge the 
          tags as well as a data port to transfer data. Over the past year, the System Architecture sub-team has 
          also been working on a Caravel chip, which we plan to add to the tag as well. We would have to add flash 
          memory so that we can store data on the tag. We also plan on adding a chip to measure the battery status 
          of the device so that it can communicate with the Caravel chip, and a clock so that we can control when 
          the device gets data. Lastly, there needs to be a mechanical support for the harness so that the tag is 
          easily placed onto the bird. Tarango has been using a rappole-style harness, which allows for the tag to 
          be attached on the back of the bird, similar to a backpack. 
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
          Along with the requirements of the system, we have outlined some components that would be nice for Tarango 
          to have. We think that it would be helpful to have a cooling system or choose components that reduce the 
          system from heating up, since the birds are located in Florida and the tags are placed on top of the birds, 
          in direct view of sunlight. Additionally, we think that it would be useful to implement a method of geolocation 
          so that the researchers can find the tags in the case that they are lost. Through talking with Tarango, we 
          realized that charging the tags and collecting data from the tags takes a lot of time. In order to decrease 
          that time, we are thinking of potentially adding solar panels to the tags or implementing wireless charging 
          mechanisms such that multiple tags can be charged at once. For faster data collection, we are looking into 
          potentially installing PIT (passive integrated transponders) tags on the bird tags and antenna near bird nests 
          and/or frequently visited places so that when the birds pass through the area, some data can be transferred to 
          the researchers.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are currently working on the systems diagram for this device and are still looking to explore more implementations 
          to our requirements. We look forward to working with the Lab of Ornithology and to  building something that 
          will be useful for ornithology researchers.
        </p>

          Hi I'm Matt and I'm also a part of C2S2's System Architecture sub-team. This year, the System Architecture team 
          has been tasked with not only understanding the device specifics requested by Christopher Tarango and the Lab of 
          Ornithology, but also developing a shield board for testing our project team's chip after fabrication.  The shield 
          board has two main functions: ensuring correct functionality and communication with our chip, as well as creating 
          the framework for interfacing with the peripherals needed for Tarango's bird tags. At the beginning of this semester, 
          we received the fabricated shield board we developed during the fall semester and purchased programmable lab equipment 
          including a power supply (PSU), digital multimeter (DMM), function generator (FG), and oscilloscope. These tools allow 
          us to test for correct input and output voltages, depending on the requirements of each peripheral. An example of this 
          is the use of the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) we've chosen. The IMU is important for determining the orientation 
          and movement of the bird thanks to the accelerometer and gyroscope respectively. However, the input voltage of the 
          shield board is 5 Volts whereas the IMU uses an input voltage of 1.8 Volts. Since we aren't trying to fry our IMU, 
          we included two Linear and Low-dropout (LDO) regulators to drop the voltage from the input 5V to 3.3V, and then from 
          3.3V to 1.8V. When developing any form of technology, you can never just assume it works without testing, so this is 
          where the fun began.
        </p>

        <p>
          To test our shield board, I got the opportunity to help create a testing library and framework to test everything we 
          wanted to test. The testing library is designed to hold all the necessary functions needed to properly run both the PSU 
          and the DMM. Since these devices require their own specialized inputs, it was a hassle having to consistently perform a 
          'control + f' to hopefully find the correct commands. <span class="code">DMM.write(':FUNCtion:CURRent:DC')</span> and 
          <span class="code">DMM.query(':MEASure:VOLTage:DC?')</span> are both instances of the types of commands required for 
          setting the input function and the measurement we are trying to record with the DMM. Instead, I created functions that, 
          depending on the user input as a global variable, will instantly affect every instance. As an example, most commands 
          when setting the PSU require the current channel to be assigned, specifically when turning the PSU on, off, or setting 
          the voltage and current: <span class="code">supply.write(':APPL CH1,5,0.2')</span>, where 5 is the input for 5V and 0.2 
          is for 0.2 A. However, there are multiple instances in the scripts where that would need to be changed. Let's be honest, 
          that creates room for user error and confusion when trying to debug why the script isn't running correctly. By only having 
          to set one variable, this can avoid those errors and allow for more rapid testing with different values. I've also created 
          a way for users to test Voltage versus Voltage, Voltage versus Current, Current versus Voltage, and Current versus Current. 
          But why test Voltage versus Voltage or Current versus Current? This leads back to the LDOs. If we are providing an input 
          voltage of 5V, we need to ensure that the output of the second LDO is actually 1.8V.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is also one huge benefit with creating the testing library and keeping the main script users run separate: the run 
          script is 10 lines of code, besides comments explaining the inputs whereas the library is over 500 lines of code, making 
          editing a nightmare if the scripts were combined. As of right now, our testing library only contains the functions for the 
          PSU and the DMM, but as our equipment becomes more sophisticated and further testing is required, the team will need to use 
          both the function generator and the oscilloscope, both of which have their own programming requirements and specific commands. 
          While I don't know how much code is needed to run either of these devices, I can only imagine how complex our testing script 
          would become without having the library.
        </p>

        <p>
          As I am graduating this semester from the Masters of Engineering Program in Electrical and Computer Engineering, it is crucial 
          to me that I do everything I can to ensure that the future of this project team can run smoothly, allowing the next generation 
          of students in the System Architecture team to easily perform any test they want to run, while also allowing students to readily 
          update their testing methodologies. My work this year has been extraordinary and I'm so excited to see what the future holds for C2S2.
