          In the vast realm of computer science, few processes are as seemingly mysterious and yet fundamentally
          essential as
          memory allocation. Imagine a backstage pass to a grand orchestra, where every musician has their unique place
          and role.
          That's what malloc does - it's the unsung maestro orchestrating where each byte sits, ensuring the symphony of
          data flows
          seamlessly. But have you ever wondered about the intricacies of this vital function? How does malloc weave its
          magic,
          especially when working on bare metal, away from the safety nets of high-level abstractions? "Bare" with me as
          I explain
          how C2S2 is building its own bare metal malloc.
        </p>

        <p>
          At its core, malloc stands for memory allocation. In C programming and its derivatives, it's a function that
          reserves a
          contiguous block of memory of a specified size and returns a pointer to the initial byte. Think of computer
          memory as a vast
          library, and each byte as a bookshelf. When you invoke malloc, you're effectively asking the librarian (the
          memory manager)
          to reserve a certain number of these shelves for you. The function then hands you a reference card (pointer)
          indicating the
          starting point of your reserved section.
        </p>

        <h2>How does a Bare Metal Malloc work?</h2>

        <p>
          The working of Malloc can be divided into these following parts:
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Memory Management and Segmentation:</strong> In a computer system, memory can be visualized as an
          expansive
          linear array of
          bytes. For management purposes, this memory landscape is segmented into blocks. Each block holds metadata
          about its
          size and whether
          it's currently in use or free.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Linear Search and Allocation:</strong> When a program calls malloc, the function embarks on a linear
          search
          through these blocks. It seeks out a free block that can satisfy the requested memory size. The search is
          generally
          from the beginning of the memory, proceeding block-by-block, assessing the metadata to find a fitting vacancy.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Intelligent Memory Optimization:</strong> If malloc locates a free block larger than the requested size, it
          doesn't simply hand over the entire block. To prevent wastage, the block is split based on the requested size. The
          surplus memory remains free, primed for subsequent allocations, ensuring memory is used judiciously.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Pointer Provision:</strong> Post the allocation and optional splitting, malloc doesn't just leave the program
          guessing where its reserved memory starts. It provides a precise address to the beginning of the allocated memory
          block in the form of a pointer, serving as a clear reference for the program to access and manipulate its newly
          acquired memory space.
        </p>

        <figure>

        </figure>

        <p>
          Memory management is not just about allocation; an equally crucial aspect is the deallocation of memory. This process
          is facilitated by the free function. When a memory block, previously allocated by malloc, is no longer required, it
          must be returned to the pool of available memory to ensure efficient utilization. Not doing so leads to what's
          commonly referred to as a memory leak, where unused memory accumulates over time, potentially consuming all available
          memory and causing system slowdowns or crashes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Upon invocation, the free() function does several things:
        </p>

        <ol style="display: block; text-align: left;">
          <li><strong>Block Identification:</strong> It first identifies the memory block associated with the provided pointer.
            This often involves referencing metadata, or bookkeeping information, that was established when the block was
            initially allocated.</li>
          <li><strong>Memory Merging:</strong> One of the significant challenges with memory deallocation is fragmentation. Over
            time, as memory is continuously allocated and deallocated, you can end up with a landscape of scattered free blocks,
            interleaved with used ones. To address this, once a block is freed, the algorithm checks its immediate neighbors. If
            either or both of the neighboring blocks are free, they get merged to form a larger contiguous free block. This
            process is often termed coalescing.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          There are other steps like updating Metadata, maintaining free lists (for faster future allocations), etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          The software team has been working on its own bare metal malloc tailored for our custom chip. A big part of the
          process has been analyzing our chip's architecture and the target applications it would run. However, building the
          malloc is just part of the journey. We also plan on rigorous testing, where we simulate various scenarios, from
          typical workloads to edge cases, ensuring our system's reliability and efficiency. Currently with our high level
          abstraction ready, we are all set to implement the algorithm to get our orchestra singing!
