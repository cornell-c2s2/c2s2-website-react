            Along with designing Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), a major goal of
            the System Architecture subteam is to validate the functionality of
            the PCB after fabrication. This validation process can be split into
            five parts: visual inspection, component placement analysis,
            continuity and short testing, power supply check, and functional
            testing. In this blog post, we aim to explain this testing and
            validation process, while demonstrating our current work in this
            area.
          </p>

          <p>
            We first send our designs made using Altium for fabrication.
            Examples of some of the designs we have worked on are in the images
            below. The first image is of our Sensor Shield, which has various
            sensors for our use. The second image is of a PCB that supports the
            ATMEGA32U4-AUR microcontroller unit (MCU).

          </figure>

          <p>
            After we receive our fabricated PCBs, we begin with a visual
            inspection. This involves looking for any visible defects on the PCB
            such as solder bridges (unintended connections), missing components,
            incorrect component placements, or damaged traces. In order to do so
            successfully, it is important to use good lighting and sometimes
            even a magnifying glass.
          </p>

          <p>
            Next is component placement analysis in which we ensure that all
            components are correctly placed according to the PCB design. We
            first ensure that all components are correctly placed according to
            the PCB design which we created using Altium. We then verify
            component orientation and polarity (for diodes, capacitors, and
            integrated circuits). Lastly, we double check that components are
            placed in their designated locations on the PCB.
          </p>

          <p>
            Arguably, one of the most important steps in the verification
            process is continuity and short testing in which we use a multimeter
            to check for electrical continuity between various points on the
            board; we also ensure that there are no unintended shorts between
            traces or components. Unintended shorts are detrimental because they
            result in massive amounts of electrical current going through a
            circuit, which can harm parts used in the board. In using the
            multimeter, we first place one probe on ground and use the other
            probe to check continuity between all critical points on the PCB,
            ensuring that there is a complete electrical path where expected.
          </p>

          </figure>

          <p>
            After the circuitry has been checked and has passed all tests, it is
            time to supply voltage to the board and test for functionality. When
            performing power supply checking, supply a range of voltages to the
            PCB and use a voltage meter or oscilloscope to measure voltage
            levels at critical points, such as power rails and voltage
            regulators. Lastly, we perform functional testing in which we
            connect the PCB to the intended system and check if it performs its
            intended functions.
          </p>

          <p>
            The method of performing testing and validation can vary depending
            on which PCB we are testing. As an example, here were our steps in
            performing testing on the MCU PCB.
          </p>

          <p>
            After fabricating the ATMEGA32U4 PCB, we performed visual
            inspection, component placement analysis, and continuity testing
            successfully based on the methodology described above. When it came
            to functional validation, we first attempted to write a simple LED
            blink program using the Microchip Studio IDE. However, we ran into
            issues getting both an on-board LED and external LED hooked up to
            the board to illuminate properly.
          </p>

          <p>
            To troubleshoot, we researched how to configure the ATMEGA32
            microcontroller to blink an LED using its native Atmel Studio IDE
            and assembly language programming. By stepping through the detailed
            instructions on register configuration and code execution in an
            article, we were able to understand exactly what needs to be set up
            in order to control the I/O pins and LEDs. Specifically, we learned
            how the DDR and PORT registers allow configuration of each
            microcontroller pin as either input or output. We also saw how the
            PORT register bits can be set high or low to manipulate external
            devices like LEDs connected to those pins.
          </p>

          <p>
            Armed with this improved register-level grasp, we proceeded to test
            the LED blink code. By methodically walking through the logic in
            debugging mode within Atmel Studio, we could validate that the LDI,
            OUT, and other assembly instructions properly manipulated the PORTC
            pins in order to produce the LED state changes. Below is the code:
          </p>

            {`#include <xc.h>
  #include <avr/io.h>

  int main( void ) {

      // Set PD5 as output
      DDRD |= ( 1 << DDD5 );

      while( 1 ) {
          // Turn LED on
          PORTD |= ( 1 << PORTD5 );
          // Delay
          for( int i = 0; i < 100000; i++ ) {
              asm( "nop" );
          }

          // Turn LED off
          PORTD &= ~( 1 << PORTD5 );
          // Delay
          for( int i = 0; i < 100000; i++ ) {
              asm( "nop" );
          }
      }
  }`}{" "}
          </pre>

          <p>
            After repeatedly reviewing the program execution to strengthen our
            comprehension, we successfully uploaded the finalized code to the
            physical ATMEGA32 chip on our PCB. Both onboard and external LEDs
            now properly turned on and off in the expected blinking pattern,
            proving full functionality! This experience demonstrated how clearly
            understanding internal microcontroller behavior through register
            manipulation is essential to be able to control and validate
            external device operations.
          </p>

          <p>
            To methodically validate the performance of our designed PCBs, we
            also create testing tables to track measurement equipment used,
            specific parameters verified, and pass/fail outcomes for each
            component. Below are the tables we utilized during the validation
            process for our MCU PCB:
          </p>

            <figcaption>Testing Validation Tables (MCU)</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            By using such rigorous testing tables during PCB validation, we can
            be confident that any potential fabrication issues are caught prior
            to system integration.
