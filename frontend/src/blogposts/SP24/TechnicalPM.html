          Hi, I'm Taylor, and my name is Jason. We're both part of the C2S2 Project Management subteam. In our last blog post, we
          discussed our initial project, which involved redesigning the sponsorship packet and newsletter for our sponsors and
          alumni. By updating the design and incorporating technical details about the subteams' achievements and goals, we
          provided a visually appealing and informative snapshot of C2S2's current initiatives. This revamped sponsorship packet
          proved important in facilitating a prompt response to a potential collaboration opportunity with Synopsys.
        </p>

        <p>
          This semester, as all subteams forge ahead with new projects, the PM team has focused on enhancing external
          communications and keeping our documents up-to-date. An important update was adding an all-team photo taken after we
          received our merchandise at the semester's start. These photos have been utilized in various events and outreach
          materials, such as the Intel presentation and our sponsorship packet. Reflecting on feedback from last fall's pitch
          demo, we realized the importance of balancing both the people side and the technical work side when presenting ourselves
          to the outside. Throughout the semester, we frequently captured moments of collaboration and daily activities in the
          ELL, especially during chip testing, CNF training sessions, and social events. These images, showcasing our team in C2S2
          shirts, strengthen our collective identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, we attended subteam meetings and design reviews to gather information about ongoing projects, which helped
          us provide a richer narrative in our updated newsletter. The newsletter now includes detailed accounts of past
          achievements and current objectives for the spring semester, while the sponsorship packet remains a concise summary
          designed to spark corporate interest.

          On March 22nd, C2S2 hosted an event with AMD experts and several ECE alumni to discuss our progress and gain insights
          into industry practices. Mr. Kashem's lecture on design thinking, illustrated through the simple example of a ball pen,
          emphasized the importance of project management in defining outcomes, addressing team needs, planning events, and
          engaging with stakeholders-vital for many organizations' success. During the dinner, Taylor, Abigail, Adele, and I
          engaged Mr. Kashem in a discussion about AMD's project management practices. He mentioned that AMD has more specialized
          project groups and advised us to maintain a higher than current PM member ratio to facilitate design. He also
          recommended the use of Gantt charts and communication methods that have proven effective at AMD. His insights affirmed
          the value of our work and provided guidance on improving subteam communication and managing external events.

          This spring, we also explored more visual and interactive methods to communicate our work and team to the broader
          Cornell community and beyond. Following the high interest shown by Cornell students and high schoolers in our fall
          community engagement event, we recognized the need for more accessible information. During the giving day, we collected
          concise updates from subteam leads and combined this with footage to create a video for C2S2, which was shared on
          Instagram and will soon be available on our website. We are also developing new content, including videos on CNF
          training and chip imaging, to enrich our online presence further.

          As we interacted with various subteams to understand their technical projects, our Project Management team is evolving
          to embrace more technical aspects and has discovered a passion for projects like RF design. The RFIC project being
          pursued by C2S2 has been in the making since the beginning of the Winter break of the 2023-24 academic year. The thought
          process for this technical expansion of the team follows from the new tools developed for the SKY130 PDK and the
          previous projects that the analog team has pursued. In November 2023, Cadence and Skywater announced that they have
          collaborated with one another to release a Cadence-compatible version of the SKY130 PDK; this would allow us to add many
          of Cadence's tools and features for more advanced projects that C2S2 would like to pursue. This would include an
          expansion into RF systems, which would normally require advanced electromagnetic simulations that we currently do not
          have access to. In addition, most of our past analog projects have been in the realm of mixed-signal design; to
          diversify team members' learning experiences, we would also like to introduce and cultivate RF experience on the team.
          This semester, Taylor has been the main student working on setting up this project, which includes creating a
          system-level overview of what this RF module would look like and setting up the tools that would be used in designing
          the RF module at the transistor level (Cadence Virtuoso and EMX).
        </p>

        <p>
          The goal is to design a 915MHz transmitter with a wake-up receiver. If we can finish the complete design, layout, and
          simulations for the project earlier than expected, we may also look into making the design more complex by adding an I/Q
          modulated receiver in addition to the wake-up receiver; however, this idea is still in progress and, thus, is subject to
          what we can achieve in a given amount of time. We plan to begin the transistor-level design of this project in the
          summer of 2024 with a tape-out deadline of the following academic year (i.e., May 2025).
        </p>

        <p>
          It is important to make it clear that the analog team is not shifting from open-source tools to commercial tools; for
          this project, we are using Cadence tools specifically because designing an RF module is already quite difficult for a
          group of undergraduate students to succeed in; thus we do not want to make the project more difficult by using purely
          open-source tools which may risk the incompletion of the project. In particular, an accurate electromagnetic simulator,
          such as EMX, is needed to simulate our RFIC designs and account for the parasitics that will arise from our layout.
          Without this tool, the project's success would decrease significantly as there is no comparable open-source analogue.
          The mixed-signal portion of the project team will likely continue using open-source EDA tools for the foreseeable
          future.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall, our enhancements in external communications and the initiation of the RFIC project are some of the work and
          highlights of combining strategic engagement with technical innovation in project management. Thanks for reading; we
          look forward to a bright future for C2S2!
        </p>
