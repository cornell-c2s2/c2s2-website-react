          As part of C2S2's mission, we aim to design a proof-of-concept chip to address a current challenge. Since last spring,
          C2S2 has been partnered with a Ph.D. candidate at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. From meeting with our Campus
          Partner, we learned more about his main challenges while using tags for his research. The primary concern has been the
          battery life of his current tags, as seen below, which last roughly twenty-four hours and decays after each
          deployment. Due to short battery life, he frequently has to recapture the Scrub Jays to collect data stored on the tag
          and to retag birds to collect more data. This retagging process may introduce biases to data collected as the luring
          process and human interaction may alter Scrub Jaysl natural behavior. C2S2 is focused on designing a low-power IoT
          chip that can extend the deployment period of a tag. By extending the deployment period of a tag, the team will aid in
          mitigating human interaction with birds during research studies, thus reducing human influence on data collected and
          reducing stress on birds being tagged.

        <p>
          To begin the development of a proof-of-concept chip, we've been working with other members of Project Management and
          members of System Architecture to draft a roadmap to keep the team informed about tasks and address any questions they
          might have regarding our campus partner's main challenges. The primary focus for our subteams revolves around two main
          projects: creating a more battery-efficient design and incorporating audio sample collection alongside acceleration
          data. To begin the road mapping process, the Project Management subteam first needed to develop a stronger
          understanding of the technical work of subteams. Although intended to inform alumni and sponsors of the team's
          progress, we started to build our understanding and documented what we learned of more technical aspects of projects
          for roadmapping by working on the team's newsletter.
        </p>

        <p>
          While working on the newsletter, members of Project Management frequently sat in work sessions and meetings of other
          subteams and spent more time reaching out to more technical subteams to learn more about what they previously were
          able to accomplish as well as their current progress and goals for the semester. In our newsletter, we began to gather
          information from each subteam about their projects from last year. Based on our understanding of what the subteam had
          worked on as well as official goals to accomplish for the campus partner, we helped create a flow chart, as seen
          below, to determine how each subteam should connect within the design of the chip.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/ChippingAwayAtChallenges/image2.png"/>
          <figcaption><strong>Figure 2</strong><br>First Draft of a Roadmap Flow Chart</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          To create the flow chart, we started by initially thinking of how to address the main challenge and need of our campus
          partner to collect audio recordings and acceleration data. These prompted the first inputs to be decided as both a
          microphone to collect audio samples and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to measure acceleration. The data collected
          from the IMU would be input into the Software subteam's position estimator, an algorithm designed during the spring
          semester, to determine the relative position of the tag. This relative position data would need to be offloaded so
          that a researcher would be able to relocate the tag, however, the final project of what offloading was left open-ended
          until the Project Management subteam could learn more about feasible and low power methods that could be used.
        </p>

        <p>
          Following the input of the microphone, we planned for the Analog subteam to work on an amplifier to amplify the sound
          signal as last semester they taped out a two-stage operational amplifier with Miller compensation. This semester the
          Analog subteam has been working on an Analog-to-Digitial Converter (ADC), which we included in our roadmap after the
          amplifier. As the name suggests, this ADC would convert the analog signal to a digital signal, this digital signal
          would then be used in the Digital subteam's Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to convert sound signals from the time domain
          to the frequency domain, thus allowing for spectral analysis of different frequency components. From the FFT, we move
          towards a filter, also to be designed by the Digital Subteam, which would be used to isolate specific frequency bands
          or remove unwanted noise. This filtered sound data, would then be stored in Flash Memory on the tag for a researcher
          to save and use for additional data processing.
        </p>

        <p>
          To address one of the main challenges of extending the deployment period of the tag, we also included CLK, an internal
          clock signal, as an input. This internal clock signal, with software developed by the Software subteam, would aid in
          providing synchronization of sound and acceleration data, as it would allow the researcher to relate both the sound
          and acceleration to a certain time. Time indication would also be used as an input into software, which would be
          developed by the software subteam, for scheduling when to collect samples. This scheduling would aid in extending
          deployment periods of tags, as currently once the tag turns on, it remains on and continuously collects data until it
          runs out of battery. From our Campus Partner, we learned that it would be ideal for the tag to be scheduled to collect
          samples approximately four hours after sunrise, as this is when Scrub Jays are most active. We're also considering a
          solution by introducing a "sleep mode" for the chip during the birds' inactive periods, aiming to extend battery life
          and prolong the time before tag replacement is necessary. Additionally, our partner has requested the tag to capture
          audio samples from Scrub Jays, requiring the integration of a microphone and accelerometer to record both sound and
          bird accelerations over time. The time when scheduled data was collected would similarly need to be stored in flash
          memory to relate sound and acceleration data collected to time and offloaded to assist the research in relocating the
          tag.
        </p>

        <p>
          After forming this general draft of the roadmap, Abigail was able to help present the roadmap with members of System
          Architecture during the Mid-Semester Design Reviews to get feedback from the team. Following our recent Mid-Semester
          Design Reviews, we discovered misconceptions about the challenges of our Campus Partner. To address these
          misconceptions and ensure that everyone on the team had access to research collected by the Project Management subteam
          from conversations with our Campus Partner, Abigail crafted a document to tackle common questions and provide a more
          comprehensive understanding of our campus partner's needs. We're introducing a dedicated Slack channel for roadmapping
          discussions, to not only facilitate streamlined communication but also so that other subteams and members can have
          access to information shared by Project Management to answer a question that others may also have.
        </p>

        <p>
          Similarly, from feedback from the team and learning more recent updates on projects from other subteams, we are
          currently working on updating the roadmap. Some updates we are working on updating our roadmap to reflect are
          alterations in subteam tasks, such as including Software's work on spectrography and Digital's work on creating a
          classifier, and including a Particle Photon board for offloading data. Additionally, we will continue to expand on
          this current draft of the roadmap to account for more complexity of how some projects may have the same inputs or rely
          on a different project's output by adding in levels to organize the roadmap into phases. Furthermore, we will be
          creating edits as we continue to meet both with subteams to learn more about their progress and our Campus Partner to
          learn more specific details regarding Scrub Jays' behavior and their vocal calls. Although our roadmap is still a work
          in progress, our roadmap update plans aim to enhance clarity, promote efficient communication, and ensure everyone is
          aligned as we move forward.
