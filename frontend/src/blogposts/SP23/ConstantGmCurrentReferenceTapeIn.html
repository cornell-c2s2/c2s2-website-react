      <div class="container">
        <p>
          To set the stage for this blog post, we believe it is worth discussing C2S2's overall mission: providing 
          undergraduates with the opportunity to tape-out both analog and digital integrated circuits by leveraging 
          open-source EDA tools and importantly, the open-source Skywater 130nm PDK. Emmi and I are members of C2S2's 
          analog sub-team. Our goal within C2S2's overarching mission is to tape-out a two-stage operational amplifier 
          (OTA) with an on-chip current reference this June (via Efabless' 2306 chipIgnite shuttle). Though our two-stage 
          OTA does not - by any stretch of the imagination - qualify as a novel or groundbreaking circuit, we believe it 
          will serve as a stepping stone for future undergraduate chip designers at Cornell University. It is important to 
          note that as a sub-team, our battle not only lies with circuit design, but also with the open-source analog EDA 
          tools that can be a challenge to use. No other team at Cornell University has taped-out an analog chip using Sky130. 
        </p>

        <p>
          As mentioned earlier, our tapeout is centered around a two-stage OTA with an on-chip current reference (Figure 1). 
          For this tape-in we decided to lay out the on-chip current reference, which is simply a constant-g<sub>m</sub> current source 
          as pictured in Figure 2. At a high-level, the constant-g<sub>m</sub> current source utilizes negative feedback to maintain a 
          constant current: the NMOS current mirror in the left branch mirrors current over to the right branch, which then 
          mirrors current back to the left branch by means of the PMOS current mirror. Importantly, it can be shown that 
          the current provided by a constant-g<sub>m</sub> source depends on the resistor in the right branch, and the aspect ratio of 
          the transistors (as well as some other process parameters). However, the current provided by this circuit is not a 
          function of V<sub>DD</sub>, which is a desirable trait (this is known as supply independent biasing). We designed all of our 
          circuits, including this constant-g<sub>m</sub> current source, around a V<sub>DD</sub> of 1.8V. Furthermore, we designed this constant-g<sub>m</sub> 
          current source to provide 17uA of current. This 17uA of current is then mirrored (and multiplied in the process) to 
          the tail current transistor of the OTA, which is designed to draw 250uA of current. 
        </p>

          <figcaption><strong>Figure 2</strong><br>Schematic for Constant-g<sub>m</sub> Current Source</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Continuing with our brief analysis of the constant-g<sub>m</sub> current reference, it is also worth noting that all of the transistors 
          are 1um long. These (relatively) long-channel devices are less sensitive to channel-length modulation, a phenomenon resulting 
          in the drain current of a transistor being dependent on V<sub>DS</sub>. This can throw off the amount of current provided by the transistors 
          if the V<sub>DS</sub> of any particular device is abnormally high, since current mirroring relies on the fact that drain current is mainly 
          a function of V<sub>GS</sub>. The transistors also utilize an even-numbered multiplier for better symmetry during layout. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Let us now turn our attention to the transistor in the center of the constant-g<sub>m</sub> circuit (transistor M<sub>13</sub> in Figure 2). This transistor's 
          purpose is to ensure proper start-up functionality. A constant-g<sub>m</sub> circuit can exist in one of two stable states: it can either supply the 
          desired current, or it can supply no current at all (i.e., all devices are in cutoff). To prevent the latter condition from occurring, we 
          place a diode-connected transistor between the two diode-connected transistors in the left and right branches. This way, there is a (small) 
          current path between VDD and ground during startup; this small current allows the other devices in the circuit to turn on by charging their 
          gate capacitances. We also note that the voltage we are mirroring is the voltage seen at the gate of the NMOS current-mirror. By adjusting 
          the aspect ratio of the device that is mirroring our constant-g<sub>m</sub>'s voltage, the current can either be multiplied or divided. Finally, we 
          observe that the resistor on the right branch contains 4 segments that are each 5.73um wide and 69um long. Initially, we had a sub-micron-long 
          resistor that provided us the correct resistance value during simulation. However, we soon realized that a resistor with such small physical 
          dimensions would be sensitive to any size variations during the fabrication process. With this in mind, we scaled up the size of the resistor 
          significantly and utilized multipliers for matching-purposes during layout. 
        </p>

        <p>
          To evaluate the reliability and robustness of our constant-g<sub>m</sub> current reference, we performed several different simulations. First, we performed 
          DC simulations using Ngspice and swept the supply voltage between 1.6V and 2.2V. Since the current provided by this circuit is supposed to be 
          supply-independent by design, we expect a small variation in  supplied current. Indeed, this is the case: the current only varies by 1uA across 
          a 0.6V sweep over VDD. Similarly, the NMOS gate voltage in the circuit varies by very little over the same sweep; this is to be expected since 
          this is the gate voltage that is used to mirror current. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Next, we simulated start-up conditions using transient analysis. By setting the node voltages of the circuit to be 0V initially (via the initial 
          condition spice directives) and by setting V<sub>DD</sub> to 1.8V, we can test to see if the circuit truly settles to its desired state condition. As can be 
          seen in Figure 3, the node voltages within the circuit start at 0 and eventually rise to their appropriate voltages. This is a direct consequence 
          of the current through the transistor M<sub>13</sub>, which starts at XX uA and dies down to 0A during steady-state operation. It is important to note that 
          under steady-state conditions, the start-up transistor is not on; this is clearly shown by the bias-voltages associated with this transistor.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
          After performing the aforementioned simulations, we proceeded to lay out our circuit using Magic. During our floor-planning, we decided to use a 
          y-axis of symmetry to guide our layout. By using this axis of symmetry, each device should be similarly affected by process variation. Under this 
          layout philosophy, the transistors are placed in horizontal rows; transistors are then stacked vertically. As a team, we decided to use M1 to make 
          horizontal connections; M2 to make vertical connections; and so forth. A completed layout is shown in Figure 5.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
          Next, we instanted our layout of the constant-g<sub>m</sub> source within Efabless' Caravan pad-ring. We then routed traces from the pads to our design. 
          Importantly, we used two pads for power and ground, and two pads to probe the voltage at the gate of the NMOS current mirror and the current 
          at the bottom of the resistor. After completing the integration of our design into the provided padring, we performed DRC and LVS checks. LVS 
          was performed by Netgen, which compares the spice netlist generated by the schematic capture tool Xschem and the spice netlist generated by 
          Magic. After ensuring that our design was DRC and LVS clean, we then used Magic to perform a full parasitic extraction. The extracted spice 
          file was tied to a schematic symbol of the constant-g<sub>m</sub> circuit so we could perform the same pre-layout simulations. Unfortunately, all of the 
          currents and voltages were nonsensical in terms of their values; none of the values made any physical sense. After many hours of debugging, 
          and after speaking with Tim Edwards, we realized that Efabless' provided schematic symbol does not correctly perform port-ordering. In other 
          words, the ports on our layout do not match the ports in our schematic. This mismatch resulted in us viewing the values at ports that we did 
          not wish to probe during post-extraction simulation. After working with Tim Edwards, he kindly helped us resolve this issue by providing us 
          with the correct schematic symbol. Furthermore, this fix was pushed to the Github page for analog Caravan projects. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Returning back to post-extraction simulation, we can view the results in Figure 6. These results are in the correct order of magnitude (as 
          compared to ideal simulation results) and match our intuition for how a constant-g<sub>m</sub> current source should behave. Unfortunately, the current 
          provided by the circuit was approximately 3uA, as opposed to the desired 17uA. We realized this discrepancy was due to the fact that the traces 
          between the constant-g<sub>m</sub> circuit and the pads (in layout) were a few millimeters in length, resulting in a massive IR drop. Armed with this knowledge, 
          we performed full parasitic extraction of just the constant-g<sub>m</sub> circuit without the pad-ring and then performed the post-extraction simulations. As 
          shown in Figure 7, the performance of the extracted constant-g<sub>m</sub> circuit (without the IR drops associated with global routing) and the ideal constant-g<sub>m</sub> 
          circuit are nearly identical. 
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>
          Ultimately, this tape-in was an invaluable experience. First, it provided us the opportunity to learn how to use the open-source tools associated 
          with the Sky130 analog design flow. Second, we learned how to layout devices and perform DRC and LVS checks. Third, we learned how to perform 
          parasitic extraction, and post-extraction simulations. Lastly, this tape-in provides our sub-team with confidence. We now have a constant-g<sub>m</sub> circuit 
          that has been laid-out, extracted, and tested with parasitics. Furthermore, this design passes all of Efabless' online pre-checks and is tape-out ready. 
          Armed with this tape-in experience, our layout of the amplifier itself should be smoother and quicker. In general, this tape-in provided our team with a 
          greater feeling of confidence; we firmly believe that we can make the tapeout deadline in June.
