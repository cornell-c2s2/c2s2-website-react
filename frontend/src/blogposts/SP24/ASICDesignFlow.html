        <p>
          Over the past 2 years, C2S2 has worked on creating ASICs to provide undergraduate students with experiential learning
          opportunities in chip designing while also working to give back to the community by designing the chips to help the Lab
          of Ornithology. But what exactly is an ASIC and what is the process from idea to getting the chip back?
        </p>

        <p>
          In this blog post, we will be explaining what an ASIC is, parts of the ASIC flow, and how C2S2 has worked through the
          ASIC flow.
        </p>

        <h2>What is an ASIC?</h2>

        <p>
          ASIC stands for Application Specific Integrated Circuit and are chips designed with a single purpose. Unlike
          general-purpose integrated circuits, these chips are designed to optimally perform a single task which leads to many
          benefits including a smaller footprint, lower power consumption, and higher performance than other general-purpose
          devices such as FPGAs that can be used for many tasks.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a result of these benefits, ASICs have a multitude of applications in many industries and can be seen in everyday
          life. Custom chips can be found in cell phones, digital watches, toys, cars, and other devices to control how the device
          will function. From this short list of applications, it can be seen that ASICs are used in telecommunications,
          automotive, entertainment, and many other industries.
        </p>

        <h2>What are the Design Steps to Create an ASIC?</h2>

        <p>
          The ASIC design flow is the process that is followed to go from the idea to having the GDS file to be sent to the
          foundry to fabricate the chip. We have broken this design flow into the following 9 steps in this blog post. The figure
          below shows these 9 steps in addition to the categories which these steps can be divided into. In red are the steps
          related to creating the register transfer level (RTL) design. Following this are the steps in green which is the logic
          design phase, and after the logic design phase is the physical design phase.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/ASICDesignFlow/image1.png"/>
          <figcaption><strong>Figure 1</strong></figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>Design Specification</h2>

        <p>
          To begin a project, the design specifications, including the chip's purpose and the device's intended operation, need to
          be specified. Specifications include defining the functionality of the created chip, inputs and outputs, performance,
          space, and power consumption, and these specifications are followed throughout the design process.
        </p>

        <p>
          Within C2S2, design specification was completed while speaking with our campus partner, the Lab of Ornithology, to
          determine their wants and needs for a custom bird tag such as being low-power, compact, able to collect audio data and
          bird movement, and configurable to change settings such as when to collect data. Following speaking with our campus
          partner we specified that being low power to extend the battery life of the bird tag and having a microphone and
          accelerometer are the main requirements of the system produced to fit the campus partner's needs. Below is a diagram
          showing the end goal of the created system and how it will be used. Furthermore, the white box labeled C2S2 tapeout
          shows where the created chip(s) are and their purpose in the data flow and overall system. In this system the yellow
          boxes denote the analog team's chip and the green specifies the digital team's chip, and for this blog post we will
          focus on the digital team's view of going through the ASIC design flow.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/ASICDesignFlow/image2.png"/>
          <figcaption><strong>Figure 2</strong></figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>RTL Description</h2>

        <p>
          Register transfer level (RTL) description is the next step after design specification. At this step, the high-level
          abstraction of the digital circuit is created using a hardware description language (HDL) such as Verilog or VHDL. In
          practice this is when designers define the operation of the system, create data paths, and write the control logic to
          achieve the desired functionality of the chip. One thing to note at this step is that this definition of the operation
          of the chip does not involve focusing on the physical implementation of the system such as the layout of transistors or
          routing of interconnections, but rather on writing the digital logic of the design.
        </p>

        <p>
          While working on C2S2 this design step looks like writing Verilog to specify the data flow and creating the modules as
          seen in the system architecture diagram of the digital team's tapeout this year. Once the modules are created the system
          is connected to create a system composed of the different submodules.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/ASICDesignFlow/image3.png"/>
          <figcaption><strong>Figure 3</strong></figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>Functional Verification</h2>

        <p>After writing the Verilog for the system and connecting the modules, the system is tested for functionality by writing
        test benches that simulate having different inputs given to the system and comparing the outputs to what is expected.
        </p>

        <p>
          On C2S2 we complete the functional verification stage by writing PyMTL test benches to check for correct outputs given
          different inputs including what happens when there are delays and different types, combinations, and values of inputs.
          At this stage, the goal is to test all possible cases and ensure that the functionality for these tests is deterministic
          and reproducible. The figure below shows some testing completed for the FFT module of the system.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="imgs/ASICDesignFlow/image4.png"/>
          <figcaption><strong>Figure 4</strong></figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>Logic Synthesis</h2>

        <p>
          Following testing of the functionality of the design, the RTL design is transformed into a gate level netlist through
          logic synthesis. Logic synthesis can be broken down into 3 steps including translation, optimization, and technology
          mapping. During translation, the RTL code is translated into boolean equations (technology independent synthesis), and
          these boolean equations are then optimized using optimization methods such as sum of products (SoP) or product of sums
          (PoS). After optimizing the boolean, the boolean logic is then mapped to logic gates (technology-dependent synthesis).
          This process of mapping boolean logic equations to logic gates in the target standard cell library is dependent on the
          technology being used to tapeout the chip.
        </p>

        <p>
          Within our team the steps of logic synthesis until our GDS output is done by pushing our design through OpenLANE, to
          harden and synthesize our design.
        </p>

        <h2>Gate Level Netlist </h2>

        <p>
          Once the logic synthesis is complete, Caravel generates gate level netlists for our design. For starters, a gate level
          netlist is a low-level description of a circuit that contains all of the primitive circuit instantiations and their
          appropriate connections. The netlist is stored in a Verilog file, but although it looks like a typical module, it only
          defines variables and connects them, and does not actually have any functions. Gate level netlists provide us with an
          alternate form of testing, which we can use towards the end of our flow to observe and manipulate signals in specific
          wires. These netlists are also foundational to the further checks that Openlane carries out.
        </p>

        <h2>Logic Equivalence Check</h2>
        <p>
          Once we have our netlists output from logic synthesis, Openlane performs checks on the timings of signals, making sure
          that they fall within specifications. Openlane does this with OpenSTA, which is an open source gate level static time
          verifier, which is fed the design netlist with a configuration file. In the config file, we declare the clock period and
          the amount of "slack" the chip has in its setup and hold time, indicating the amount of time the chip must hold its
          signal before and after the clock period. OpenSTA then outputs timing reports, with detailed information on whether each
          signal successfully fell within appropriate times, or how much time they were off by. An important factor involved in
          this process of the flow is the clock period of the circuit, therefore this step gives us a good indication of how well
          the clock period is allowing the signals to flow and if we need to slow it down or we can speed it up.
        </p>

        <h2>Place and Route & Physical Layout </h2>

        <p>
          Once it has been verified that the design fulfills all logic tests, meaning functionally our chip is behaving how we
          want it to, Openlane begins to physically 'lay out the pieces'. Still, as stand-alone blocks our modules are basically
          useless in the real world, which is why it is placed on the Efabless Caravel harness. The harness is basically a chip which supports basic
          functions, such as IO, power, and an SoC (System on Chip) core, and provides us with a user project wrapper where we can
          place all of our modules within an allocated area of 3000um x 3600um.
        </p>

        <p>
          Openlane does this process with OpenROAD, an open source tool that provides flow scripts for the process of actually
          putting things on the physical chip design. This can be broken down into roughly four major stages: Floorplan,
          Placement, CTS, and Routing. All of these stages have many MANY steps that go on behind the scenes that are crucial to
          the flow, but it is still important to understand the basic idea and goal of each of them. Floorplan starts us off by
          defining the area the chip is going to take up and creating the power distribution network that all our components will
          work with. Placement places our macros where we have specified them to be, and also places all our cells and optimizes
          such placement with regards to factors such as slew, capacitance, and wire length. CTS or Clock Tree Synthesis
          identifies high-fanout nets, or connections that indicate a lot of loads, and resizes and places buffers accordingly in
          order to distribute the clock network. Lastly, Routing is the stage in which all modules are connected appropriately,
          ensuring that basic time and power violations do not occur.
        </p>

        <h2>Physical Verification </h2>

        <p>
          Right before the final results are outputted, Openlane undergoes various signoff processes that ensure the chip meets
          all physical requirements. This includes DRC checking, or Design Rule Checking, which verifies that the design meets the
          constraints of the technology involved in its manufacturing. Still, this does not guarantee that it represents the
          circuit we wish to fabricate, which is why alongside other verifications, Openlane also performs an LVS check, or Layout
          Versus Schematic check. As the name suggests, it compares the layout to the original circuit schematic, ensuring
          consistency through the hardening process. This is done by comparing the netlists of the circuits and asserting that
          they match.
        </p>

        <h2>GDS</h2>

        <p>
          Lastly, our final output for the process is the GDS file. This file stores information about where everything is
          physically located in each layer of the final design. This is the final product of the chip design process, and it is
          what we send to the foundry in order to have the chip physically constructed. The figure below on the left gives a
          visual representation of the GDS file and the figure on the right is a picture of the digital team's chip from 2023.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
          The ASIC design flow is a multistep process that involves designers at all steps of the process from idea to getting a
          chip and although this process can be difficult and long, going through this process yields a chip that can greatly
          improve the performance of a system and opens the doors for innovation and unparalleled efficiency.
        </p>

        <p>
          We hope this blog post has given you a better understanding of the ASIC design flow and insight into a real experience
          going through this design process. From working on C2S2 it has truly been a cool experience to go through each of these
          steps and see how a chip can be designed from an idea to having a tapeout and getting the chip back.
